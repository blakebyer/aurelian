      "## GO-CAM Model Review Summary - gomodel:5e72450500004019\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This model titled \"SARS-COV2/HOST\" provides a detailed representation of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and the host innate immune response system, particularly focusing on the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway. The model effectively depicts how various SARS-CoV-2 proteins antagonize key components of the human antiviral signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive coverage**: The model successfully captures multiple aspects of the host-pathogen interaction involving SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their targets in the human innate immune system.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence-based assertions**: Most activities and causal associations are well-supported by primary literature references, with appropriate evidence codes (primarily ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological accuracy**: The representation of RLR signaling components (IFIH1/MDA5, RIG-I, MAVS) and their interactions is consistent with current scientific knowledge as verified through UniProt entries and primary literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clear mechanistic view**: The model provides a clear view of how SARS-CoV-2 proteins target different stages of the antiviral signaling pathway, providing a coherent picture of viral immune evasion strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Precise cellular context**: Activities are properly annotated with subcellular locations (cytoplasm, mitochondria, nucleus), which is crucial for understanding compartmentalized signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing evidence for some causal associations**: Several causal relationships lack evidence annotations, including:\n",
      "   - The connection between IRF3 (Q14653-5) and nsp16 (P0DTD1-PRO_0000449633)\n",
      "   - The connection between nsp16 (P0DTD1-PRO_0000449633) and nsp1 (P0DTD1-PRO_0000449619)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing \"has input\" annotations**: According to GO-CAM best practices for:\n",
      "   - Protein sequestering activity: Several activities with GO:0140311 (protein sequestering activity) lack \"has input\" relations to specify which protein is being sequestered\n",
      "   - E3 ubiquitin ligase activity: Activities with GO:0061630 (ubiquitin protein ligase activity) lack \"has input\" annotations to indicate the ubiquitination targets\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Specific activity branches could be expanded**: \n",
      "   - The IRF3 transcription factor activity could be enhanced by specifying its gene targets with \"has input\" relations\n",
      "   - For several proteins, more specific ubiquitination process terms could be provided (e.g., K48-linked vs. K63-linked)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal relationship annotations**: Some relationships use RO:0002411 (concurrence with) instead of more specific causal relationships like indirect positive/negative regulation\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Lack of cellular response outcomes**: The model could be extended to more clearly indicate downstream effects of the innate immune suppression on cellular outcomes or viral replication.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Content Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 interference with the innate immune system. The key components include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **RIG-I/MDA5 pathway**: Correctly represented as cytoplasmic PRRs that recognize viral RNA and signal through MAVS.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MAVS as a central hub**: The model properly captures MAVS as the central adaptor for signaling through the TRAF3/TBK1/IRF3 cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Viral antagonism**: The model correctly represents multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins interfering with signaling at different levels:\n",
      "   - M protein inhibits MAVS (consistent with PMID:33110251)\n",
      "   - nsp3 deISGylates MDA5 to prevent its activation\n",
      "   - ORF9b targets mitochondria and affects MAVS signaling\n",
      "   - nsp1 suppresses host translation\n",
      "   - Various proteins target IRF3 activity\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Downstream effects**: The model adequately shows the disruption of both IRF3 and NF-κB activation by viral proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conformance to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices but has some areas for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Protein sequestering activities**: While correctly using GO:0140311 and RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) to connect to downstream activities, it's missing the required \"has input\" relation to specify the target protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **E3 ubiquitin ligase activities**: The model correctly uses GO:0061630 for TRIM25, TRAF3, and TRAF6, but lacks \"has input\" relations and specific ubiquitination process terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **DNA-binding transcription factor activity**: The IRF3 activity is correctly located in the nucleus (GO:0005634) and part of mRNA transcription (GO:0009299), but misses specific gene targets with \"has input\" and uses RO:0002411 instead of indirect regulatory relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Specific Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add missing evidence annotations**: Provide evidence for all causal associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add \"has input\" relations**: Add these for:\n",
      "   - Protein sequestering activities (GO:0140311) to specify which proteins are being sequestered\n",
      "   - E3 ubiquitin ligase activities (GO:0061630) to indicate ubiquitination targets\n",
      "   - IRF3 transcription factor activity to specify gene targets\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enhance IRF3 activity representation**: Use appropriate causal relations like \"indirectly positively regulates\" instead of \"concurrence with\" when connecting IRF3 to downstream effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add specific ubiquitination terms**: Where known, specify the type of ubiquitination (K48-linked vs. K63-linked) to provide more precise annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add cellular outcomes**: Consider extending the model to show the ultimate effects of these pathways on viral replication or cellular outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model provides a valuable representation of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with the human innate immune system, particularly the RLR signaling pathway. The model is scientifically accurate, well-supported by evidence, and generally follows GO-CAM best practices. With some modest improvements to add missing annotations and relations, it would fully conform to best practices while enhancing its biological clarity and comprehensiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents an important contribution to understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and immune evasion strategies, which is particularly valuable in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "COMMAND: Review gomodel:5e72450500004237\n",
      "LOOKUP GOCAM: 5e72450500004237\n",
      "FETCH DOCUMENT: How_to_annotate_complexes_in_GO-CAM\n",
      "Based on the complex annotation guidelines, I'd recommend that for cases like the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase complex, where multiple viral proteins work together, the model should clearly represent which subunit carries which activity - which is already done in this model. However, the relationships between complex members could be made clearer through the activity flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add evidence for all causal relationships**: Ensure all causal associations have appropriate evidence codes and PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use more specific causal predicates**: Replace general RO:0002411 (causally upstream of) terms with more specific ones like RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) or RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) where possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complete the biological processes**: Ensure all molecular functions are associated with appropriate biological processes to provide full context.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Review virus-host interactions**: Consider adding more explicit representation of key host factors that interact with viral proteins, particularly for immune evasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Check activity flow**: Ensure that the flow of activities accurately represents the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle based on current literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Update evidence codes**: For some annotations using ECO:0000250 (sequence similarity evidence), consider if more direct evidence is now available given the extensive research on SARS-CoV-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model representing the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle with strong evidence support. The identified issues are relatively minor and addressing them would further enhance the model's utility and accuracy.\n",

      "Based on my review of the GO-CAM model and relevant information, here's my assessment of gomodel:5fce9b7300002336 (SPModule-TREM1-DAP12):\n",
      "\n",
      "# GO-CAM Review: gomodel:5fce9b7300002336 (SPModule-TREM1-DAP12)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the signaling pathway involving TREM1 (Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1) and its adaptor protein DAP12 (TYROBP). The model shows how TREM1 activation leads to downstream signaling through DAP12, ultimately resulting in SYK kinase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular relationships**: The model correctly depicts TREM1 as a transmembrane signaling receptor that associates with DAP12, which acts as a molecular adaptor. This is consistent with the literature (PMID:10799849, PMID:9490415).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal associations**: The model uses the correct causal association predicate (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates) to show how TREM1 receptor signaling activates DAP12's adaptor activity, which then activates SYK kinase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular localization**: The model correctly annotates the activities with appropriate cellular locations - TREM1 at the cell surface (GO:0009986) and ligands in the extracellular space (GO:0005615).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Multiple ligands**: The model appropriately shows multiple ligands (PGLYRP1, HMGB1, HSPA1A) that can activate TREM1, which is supported by evidence in the literature (PMID:25595774, PMID:17568691).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Includes decoy receptor activity**: The model includes the important regulatory mechanism of the soluble isoform of TREM1 (TREM1-2) acting as a receptor decoy (GO:0140319) that negatively regulates TREM1 signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: According to the GO-CAM guidance on representing complexes, in cases where specific subunits carry known activities, each should be explicitly shown. In this model, both TREM1 and DAP12 have specific known functions (receptor activity and adaptor activity respectively), which is correctly represented. However, there should be a clearer indication that these two proteins form a functional complex together.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence details**: While the model includes PMID references for the assertions, it might benefit from more specific evidence statements describing exactly what observations from each paper support the stated relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional downstream effects**: The model shows signaling only as far as SYK kinase activity, but the literature indicates further downstream effects such as calcium mobilization, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and activation of PLC-γ (as seen in PMID:10799849). These could be added to make the model more comprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Review\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular functions**: All activities are annotated with appropriate GO terms:\n",
      "   - TREM1: GO:0004888 (transmembrane signaling receptor activity)\n",
      "   - DAP12: GO:0060090 (molecular adaptor activity)\n",
      "   - SYK: GO:0016301 (kinase activity)\n",
      "   - TREM1-2: GO:0140319 (receptor decoy activity)\n",
      "   - Ligands: GO:0048018 (receptor ligand activity)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The causal relationships use the correct relationship predicates:\n",
      "   - Ligands directly positively regulate TREM1 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "   - TREM1 directly positively regulates DAP12 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "   - DAP12 directly positively regulates SYK (RO:0002629)\n",
      "   - TREM1-2 directly negatively regulates TREM1 (RO:0002630)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular context**: Appropriate cellular locations are provided:\n",
      "   - TREM1 and DAP12 at cell surface (GO:0009986)\n",
      "   - Ligands in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The model [gomodel:5fce9b7300002336](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:5fce9b7300002336) accurately represents the TREM1-DAP12 signaling pathway with appropriate molecular functions, causal relationships, and cellular contexts. It follows GO-CAM best practices for representation of activities and their relationships. \n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be enhanced by:\n",
      "1. Making the TREM1-DAP12 complex relationship more explicit\n",
      "2. Adding more downstream signaling events beyond SYK activation\n",
      "3. Providing more detailed evidence statements\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that effectively captures the essential aspects of TREM1-DAP12 signaling.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the BMP9 signaling pathway in humans, showing how BMP9 (GDF2) activates its receptors and triggers downstream signaling. The pathway includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. BMP9/GDF2 (UniProtKB:Q9UK05) acting as a growth factor\n",
      "2. Type II receptors: ACVR2B (UniProtKB:Q13705) and BMPR2 (UniProtKB:Q13873)\n",
      "3. Type I receptor: ACVRL1/ALK1 (UniProtKB:P37023)\n",
      "4. Downstream effector: SMAD1 (UniProtKB:Q15797)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate representation of pathway components**: The model correctly includes the main components of the BMP9 signaling pathway.\n",
      "2. **Proper cellular localization**: The model appropriately places components in their correct cellular locations (BMP9 in extracellular space, receptors in plasma membrane).\n",
      "3. **Correct pathway association**: All activities are properly associated with the BMP signaling pathway (GO:0030509).\n",
      "4. **Evidence support**: Each activity and relationship is supported by evidence from peer-reviewed literature.\n",
      "5. **Directionality of signaling**: The model correctly shows the flow of information from ligand to downstream effector.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Relationship between GDF2 and its receptors\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows GDF2 directly positively regulating both ACVR2B and BMPR2. According to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\", the relationship between a ligand and its receptors should be represented using the predicate \"directly positively regulates\". This is correctly implemented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Relationship between type II and type I receptors\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows both type II receptors (ACVR2B and BMPR2) directly positively regulating the type I receptor ACVRL1, which is consistent with the known mechanism where type II receptors phosphorylate and activate type I receptors in the BMP signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Missing parts of the signaling pathway\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model captures the main components, I recommend adding:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The formation of the receptor complex between type I and type II receptors upon BMP9 binding\n",
      "- The SMAD1 transcription factor activity leads to transcriptional regulation of target genes\n",
      "- The model could benefit from depicting additional SMAD proteins (SMAD4, SMAD5) that form complexes with SMAD1\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Missing input relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the guidelines, receptors should have their downstream targets identified via \"has input\" relationships. While the causal associations are correct, the explicit input relationships could be made clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Other BMPs and their signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "The model focuses exclusively on BMP9/GDF2, but other BMPs (like BMP10) can also signal through these receptors. Consider mentioning this in a note or expanding the model to include alternative ligands.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Verification with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by literature evidence. I've verified key aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PMID:7664647 and PMID:19366699 support GDF2/BMP9 as activating BMPR2 and ACVR2B receptors\n",
      "2. PMID:8622651 and PMID:8395525 support ACVR2B function in this pathway\n",
      "3. PMID:22718755 confirms ACVRL1/ALK1 as the type I receptor in this cascade\n",
      "4. PMID:8653785 supports SMAD1's role as a downstream effector\n",
      "\n",
      "This is consistent with current understanding of the BMP9 signaling pathway, where BMP9 binds to type II receptors (ACVR2B or BMPR2), which then phosphorylate and activate the type I receptor ACVRL1/ALK1, which in turn phosphorylates and activates SMAD1 to regulate gene expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"600ced8500002343\" accurately represents the core BMP9 signaling pathway in humans, with proper molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing signaling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations for improvement:**\n",
      "1. Consider adding additional downstream components (e.g., SMAD4 complex formation) \n",
      "2. Clarify the input relationships for the receptors\n",
      "3. Add more detail about the transcriptional targets regulated by SMAD1\n",
      "4. Consider including notes about alternative ligands (like BMP10) that can act through the same pathway\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed model that provides a clear representation of the BMP9 signaling pathway.\n",

      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: 60418ffa00000327 - Xanthine catabolic process (Mouse)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:60418ffa00000327](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:60418ffa00000327)) represents the xanthine catabolic process in mouse (Mus musculus, NCBI Taxon: 10090). The model depicts the pathway for the degradation of purines into allantoin, focusing on the conversion of xanthine to uric acid and its subsequent metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Structure and Model Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents the purine catabolism pathway in mice, showing:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Initial conversion of xanthine by xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (Xdh) activity \n",
      "2. Oxidation of uric acid by urate oxidase (Uox)\n",
      "3. Subsequent processing by hydroxyisourate hydrolase (Urah)\n",
      "4. Final conversion to allantoin by 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline decarboxylase (Urad)\n",
      "\n",
      "The flow of activities follows the correct biochemical sequence as supported by the references, particularly PMID:16462750, which describes the complete uric acid degradation pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Connections\n",
      "\n",
      "The model properly uses the causal relation **RO:0002413** (*provides input for*) to connect the molecular activities, indicating that the product of one reaction serves as the substrate for the next. The causal connections accurately reflect the metabolic flow:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase activities (3 instances) → urate oxidase activity\n",
      "- Urate oxidase activity → hydroxyisourate hydrolase activity\n",
      "- Hydroxyisourate hydrolase activity → 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline decarboxylase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Cellular Locations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model appropriately represents the cellular locations where these reactions occur:\n",
      "- Xanthine dehydrogenase activity is shown in both cytosol (GO:0005829) and peroxisome (GO:0005777)\n",
      "- Urate oxidase, hydroxyisourate hydrolase, and OHCU decarboxylase activities are all shown in peroxisome (GO:0005777)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is accurate according to the literature, particularly the peroxisomal localization of the later steps in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by primary literature:\n",
      "- PMID:16462750 (Ramazzina et al., 2006) is used extensively and appropriately, as it describes the complete pathway\n",
      "- PMID:1590774 (Terao et al., 1992) correctly supports the xanthine dehydrogenase aspects\n",
      "- PMID:4207016 (Lee, 1973) supports the developmental aspects of these enzymes in mice\n",
      "\n",
      "## Gene Products and Molecular Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "The gene products and their molecular functions are correctly associated:\n",
      "- MGI:MGI:98973 (Xdh) with xanthine dehydrogenase (GO:0004854) and xanthine oxidase (GO:0004855) activities\n",
      "- MGI:MGI:98907 (Uox) with urate oxidase activity (GO:0004846)\n",
      "- MGI:MGI:1916142 (Urah) with hydroxyisourate hydrolase activity (GO:0033971)\n",
      "- MGI:MGI:3647519 (Urad) with 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline decarboxylase activity (GO:0051997)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Output Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly shows allantoin (CHEBI:15676) as the final product of this pathway, which is the output of the Urad activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "I've reviewed the GO-CAM complex annotation document, and this model follows the best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The activities are properly enabled by the relevant gene products\n",

      "## Areas for Potential Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, there are a few potential improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Completeness of pathway**: The model could include the earlier steps in purine catabolism (hypoxanthine → xanthine) for a more complete representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Substrate representation**: While the model shows allantoin as the output, it could explicitly represent uric acid and other intermediates as inputs to their respective reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulatory aspects**: The model doesn't capture regulatory aspects of this pathway, such as the conversion between xanthine dehydrogenase and oxidase forms, which is mentioned in the UniProt entry for Xdh.\n",

      "\n",
      "# GO-CAM Model Review: activin receptor signaling pathway via Actbeta-babo/put (D.mel)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (https://bioregistry.io/go.model:60ad85f700000259) represents the activin receptor signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster, specifically focusing on the signaling cascade from Activin-beta (Actbeta) through the type I receptor Baboon (babo) and the type II receptor Punt (put).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts the following key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ligand**: Actbeta (FB:FBgn0024913) with cytokine activity (GO:0005125) in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "2. **Type I receptor**: Baboon (FB:FBgn0011300) with activin receptor activity (GO:0017002) on plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "3. **Type II receptor**: Punt (FB:FBgn0003169) with activin receptor activity (GO:0017002)\n",
      "4. **Signal transducer**: Smox (FB:FBgn0025800) with co-SMAD binding (GO:0070410) and DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0000981) in nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "5. **Transcription factor**: Medea (FB:FBgn0288966) with DNA-binding transcription activator activity (GO:0001228) in nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Signaling Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the canonical activin signaling pathway with appropriate causal associations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Actbeta (ligand) directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) Punt (type II receptor)\n",
      "2. Punt directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) Baboon (type I receptor)\n",
      "3. Baboon directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) Smox (R-Smad)\n",
      "4. Smox directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) both:\n",
      "   - Itself as a DNA-binding transcription factor (GO:0000981)\n",
      "   - Medea (co-Smad) as a DNA-binding transcription activator (GO:0001228)\n",
      "\n",
      "All components are appropriately labeled as part of the activin receptor signaling pathway (GO:0032924).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate receptor representation**: The model correctly depicts the type I (Baboon) and type II (Punt) receptors with appropriate molecular functions and cellular locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper signaling cascade**: The causal flow correctly shows the progression from ligand to receptor to downstream effectors with appropriate relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular compartmentalization**: Components are properly assigned to their cellular locations (extracellular space, plasma membrane, nucleus).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence support**: The model contains appropriate evidence codes and literature references, including key papers on Drosophila activin signaling (PMID:10320478, PMID:28130362).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\" document, the model follows best practices for representing protein ligand-activated signaling receptors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ligand representation**: Actbeta correctly enables cytokine activity (a child of receptor ligand activity) and is located in extracellular space.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Receptor representation**: Both receptors have appropriate activin receptor activities and the type I receptor (Baboon) is correctly located in the plasma membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relations**: The model correctly uses \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) between components of the signaling pathway, as specified in the guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Context annotation**: All activities are properly contextualized with appropriate GO cellular component terms and are part of the activin receptor signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing biological process for Medea**: While all other components are labeled as part of the activin receptor signaling pathway (GO:0032924), Medea's DNA-binding transcription activator activity is labeled as part of this process, but the process isn't explicitly connected to the component itself. This is a minor annotation issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Potential missing receptor target genes**: The model could be expanded to include specific target genes that are activated by the Smox-Medea complex, as mentioned in the reviewed literature (specifically from PMID:28130362 which mentions Atg8a as a direct target).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add biological process annotation for Medea**: Ensure that Medea is explicitly linked to the activin receptor signaling pathway (GO:0032924) process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider adding target genes**: Include specific target genes regulated by the Smox-Medea complex to make the model more comprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider adding receptor complex formation**: While the current representation is valid, explicitly modeling the formation of the receptor heterotetramer (two type I and two type II receptors) could provide additional clarity about the signaling mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider adding phosphorylation states**: Adding information about the phosphorylation of Smox by Baboon would provide additional mechanistic detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model accurately represents the activin receptor signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and follows GO-CAM best practices for signaling pathway representation. The model captures the key components, their appropriate molecular functions, cellular locations, and the causal relationships between them. With some minor enhancements as suggested above, the model could provide even more comprehensive representation of this important signaling pathway.\n",

      "### Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the 'de novo' GMP biosynthetic process in mouse (NCBITaxon:10090). It's a comprehensive pathway model that depicts the sequential enzymatic steps involved in GMP biosynthesis from the beginning of purine synthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model successfully captures the multi-step process of de novo GMP biosynthesis, including all key enzymatic steps from the beginning of purine synthesis through to the final GMP production.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal connections**: The model correctly uses the \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) predicate to show the sequential flow of enzymatic reactions through the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence quality**: Each activity in the model is supported by appropriate evidence codes and literature references (PMIDs), providing solid support for the annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular location**: Some activities appropriately specify cellular location (e.g., cytosol/GO:0005829), which enhances the biological accuracy of the model.\n",

      "5. **Species specificity**: The model is properly specified for mouse with mouse gene identifiers (MGI IDs).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "1. **Input/output molecules**: While the causal flow of activities is well represented, the model would benefit from explicitly stating the input and output molecules for each activity. This would make the model more informative for users who may not be familiar with these enzymatic activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Visualization organization**: The pathway flow would be easier to follow if the activities were organized in a linear or branched representation that visually matches the pathway's biological progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complex representation**: For any steps where the enzymatic activity is carried out by protein complexes, the model should follow GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes. The current model doesn't indicate whether any of these activities involve complexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Regulatory information**: The model could be enhanced by including regulatory information about how this pathway is controlled (e.g., feedback inhibition by end products).\n",

      "### Model Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes three key proteins:\n",
      "1. **MGI:MGI:1916969** (Cad) - multifunctional protein with three activities:\n",
      "   - Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (GO:0004088)\n",
      "   - Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (GO:0004070)  \n",

      "\n",
      "2. **MGI:MGI:1928378** (Dhodh) - with activity:\n",
      "   - Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (GO:0004152)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **MGI:MGI:1298388** (Umps) - with two activities:\n",
      "   - Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (GO:0004588)\n",
      "   - Orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (GO:0004590)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pathway Flow\n",
      "The causal flow in the model is:\n",
      "1. Cad carbamoyl-phosphate synthase → Cad aspartate carbamoyltransferase → Cad dihydroorotase → Dhodh dihydroorotate dehydrogenase → Umps orotate phosphoribosyltransferase → Umps orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase\n",
      "\n",
      "All causal connections use the predicate RO:0002413 \"provides input for\", which correctly represents the sequential enzymatic reactions in a biosynthetic pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence\n",
      "The model includes appropriate evidence for each assertion:\n",
      "- Evidence from direct assays (ECO:0000314) \n",
      "- Mutant phenotype evidence (ECO:0000315)\n",
      "- Sequence orthology evidence (ECO:0000266)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each assertion is backed by PMIDs, indicating proper literature support.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. The model correctly represents the known enzymatic activities in the de novo UMP biosynthetic pathway\n",
      "2. The causal connections accurately reflect the flow of intermediates in the pathway\n",
      "3. All activities are appropriately linked to the overall process (GO:0044205)\n",

      "5. The use of multifunctional proteins (Cad, Umps) accurately reflects the biology\n",

      "### Potential Issues\n",
      "1. There's a \"part_of\" relationship from GO:0004151 to GO:0004152 in one of the activities which seems incorrect - dihydroorotase activity shouldn't be part of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity as these are distinct enzymatic functions\n",
      "2. There's a BFO:0000050 causal association which is inconsistent with the rest of the causal associations that use RO:0002413 - this should be standardized\n",
      "3. One evidence reference has a space before the PMID (\" PMID:6154574\"), which should be fixed\n",

      "### Overall Assessment\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the UMP biosynthetic pathway in mouse with appropriate proteins, activities, and causal connections. The few minor issues identified should be addressed for complete consistency, but they don't detract from the biological accuracy of the model.\n",

      "This model represents the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway in *Drosophila melanogaster*, specifically the signaling cascade involving the TNF ligand Eiger (Egr) and the TNF receptor Grindelwald (Grnd).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clear Signaling Pathway Representation**: The model clearly depicts the TNF signaling pathway, starting with the ligand Egr (FB:FBgn0033483), through the receptor Grnd (FB:FBgn0032682), and downstream to the JNK signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Molecular Functions**: Each gene product is annotated with appropriate molecular functions that align with their known biological roles:\n",
      "   - Egr with receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018)\n",
      "   - Grnd with TNF receptor activity (GO:0005031)\n",
      "   - Traf6 with TNF receptor binding (GO:0032813)\n",
      "   - Downstream kinases with appropriate kinase activities\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper Cellular Locations**: The model includes appropriate cellular component annotations:\n",
      "   - Egr in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "   - Grnd in plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - Cytoplasmic components in cytoplasm/cytosol (GO:0005737/GO:0005829)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistent Causal Relationships**: The causal connections use \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) appropriately to show the flow of signal transduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence Support**: All associations have evidence codes with appropriate references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input Relationship for Grnd**: According to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\", the input (target) of a receptor should be the effector protein it regulates, not its ligand. In this model, there is no explicit \"has input\" relationship between Grnd and its downstream effector.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Complex Information**: If any of the components function as part of complexes, this should be indicated in the model. The JNK pathway often involves multiprotein complexes, but these are not explicitly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Veli PDZ-domain Interaction**: Based on the provided literature (Andersen et al., 2015), Grnd interacts with Veli (Lin-7) through its PDZ domain. This interaction is important for coupling Crb activity with JNK signaling, but it's not represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional Pathway Context**: The model focuses on the core TNF-JNK pathway but could be enhanced by including the connection to cell polarity determinants like Crumbs (Crb), which was highlighted in the Andersen et al. paper as an important context for Grnd function.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Predicate Usage**: The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for causal associations between pathway components, which is appropriate for direct signal transduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Part_of Relations**: All activities are appropriately indicated as part_of the TNF-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0033209).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Consistency**: The model uses a mix of evidence types (ECO:0000304, ECO:0000314, ECO:0000315, etc.) with appropriate references, showing good evidence diversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures the core TNF signaling pathway in Drosophila as described in the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Egr-Grnd Interaction**: The model correctly shows Egr as the TNF ligand that activates the Grnd receptor, consistent with the findings in Andersen et al. (2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **JNK Cascade**: The model appropriately represents the downstream JNK kinase cascade (msn → Tak1 → hep → bsk), which is a well-established pathway activated by TNF receptors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adapter Proteins**: The inclusion of Tab2 and Traf6 as adapter proteins in the signal transduction cascade is consistent with their known roles in the TNF pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a clear and accurate representation of the Drosophila TNF-mediated signaling pathway via the Egr-Grnd axis. The model follows most GO-CAM best practices and captures the essential components of the pathway with appropriate molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add \"has input\" relationships**: For the Grnd receptor, explicitly indicate its input relationship with its downstream effector (likely Traf6).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Crb-Grnd connection**: Consider expanding the model to include the relationship between Grnd and the cell polarity determinant Crumbs, as this is an important context for Grnd function described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include Veli interaction**: Add the interaction between Grnd and Veli, which is important for coupling Crb activity with JNK signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider complex annotations**: If any components function as part of complexes, explicitly represent these using the appropriate complex annotation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add biological outcomes**: Consider extending the model to include the biological outcomes of pathway activation (e.g., apoptosis, cell migration, or growth) to provide a more complete picture of the pathway's function.\n",

      "In conclusion, [gomodel:60d5209a00000233](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:60d5209a00000233) is a high-quality GO-CAM model that accurately represents the TNF signaling pathway in Drosophila, with a few opportunities for enhancement to provide additional biological context and conform more fully to GO-CAM annotation guidelines.\n",

      "### Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the torso signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). The model shows a signaling cascade initiated by ligands, receptor activation, and downstream signaling events leading to transcriptional regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model captures multiple components of the torso signaling pathway, from extracellular ligands to nuclear transcription factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate predicate usage**: The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) to connect activities in the cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular location annotations**: Most activities have appropriate cellular component annotations (e.g., extracellular space for ligands, plasma membrane for receptors).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence codes and references**: Most activities include evidence codes and PMIDs supporting the annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Standard signaling pathway structure**: The model follows the canonical structure for RTK signaling pathways from ligand → receptor → adaptor → GEF → small G protein → kinase cascade → nuclear targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Unknown molecular functions**: Several activities (enabled by FB:FBgn0003867, FB:FBgn0261016, FB:FBgn0005390, FB:FBgn0004650) have molecular function GO:0003674 (\"molecular_function\"), indicating unknown functions. This is not ideal for a production model.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: If possible, update these with more specific molecular functions based on literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete documentation of ligand-receptor interaction**: The model shows several putative ligands (tsl, clos, fs1M3, fs1N) acting on the receptor tor, but the mechanism of activation is unclear.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Based on the signaling receptor guidelines, clarify if these are direct ligands or cofactors for receptor activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Multiple redundant causal associations**: There are some duplicate causal relations, for example:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   rl (FB:FBgn0003256) --RO:0002630--> gro (FB:FBgn0001139)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   appears twice with the same evidence.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Remove duplicate causal associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Incomplete transcription factor connections**: The transcription repressor activity of cic (FB:FBgn0262582) is shown to be regulated by rl (FB:FBgn0003256), but its downstream targets are not specified.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: According to the DNA-binding transcription factor guidelines, each transcription factor should indicate its target gene(s) with \"has input\" relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Potential missing complex representation**: If any of the activities involve protein complexes, these should be represented according to the complex annotation guidelines.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Review literature to determine if any complexes should be explicitly modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",

      "# GO-CAM Model Review: dTMP Biosynthetic Process (gomodel:60e7989d00000165)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate) biosynthetic process in mouse (Mus musculus). The model describes a pathway essential for DNA synthesis, showing how various enzymes function together to produce dTMP, a critical nucleotide precursor.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Connectivity\n",
      "The model contains 9 activities connected by causal relationships using the \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) predicate, creating a coherent pathway flow. The model shows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase complex (GO:0005971) initiates the pathway by converting UDP to dUDP\n",
      "2. Multiple nucleoside diphosphate kinase activities (Nme1, Nme2, Nme3) convert dUDP to dUTP\n",
      "3. dUTP diphosphatase (Dut) converts dUTP to dUMP\n",
      "4. Thymidylate synthase (Tyms) converts dUMP to dTMP\n",
      "5. Two parallel paths involving serine hydroxymethyltransferase activities (Shmt1, Shmt2) and dihydrofolate reductase (Dhfr) support the thymidylate synthase reaction\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Compartmentalization accuracy**: The model correctly places the activities in the nucleus, which is consistent with the literature (PMID:19513116) that demonstrates nuclear de novo thymidylate biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Species specificity**: The model properly uses mouse-specific gene products (MGI identifiers) and reflects mouse biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence quality**: The model incorporates appropriate evidence codes and literature references supporting each assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pathway completeness**: The model captures all key steps in the dTMP biosynthetic pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Redundancy representation**: The model correctly represents the functional redundancy between Shmt1 and Shmt2 in nuclear folate metabolism, as demonstrated in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: The ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase complex (GO:0005971) is represented without specifying its members. According to the GO-CAM best practices for annotating complexes, if the subunits carrying specific activities are known, they should be individually represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing SUMO modification details**: The literature (PMID:19513116) emphasizes that SHMT1, DHFR, and TYMS undergo SUMOylation for nuclear localization during S and G2/M phases. This post-translational modification, which is important for nuclear localization, is not captured in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing cell cycle context**: The literature indicates that the nuclear localization of these enzymes is cell cycle-dependent (occurring during S and G2/M phases), which is not represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular details**: Some intermediate molecular steps in folate metabolism could be more explicitly modeled to show how one-carbon units from serine are utilized for thymidylate biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the literature evidence provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "- PMID:19513116 provides strong experimental evidence for nuclear thymidylate biosynthesis and the roles of SHMT1 and SHMT2 in this process\n",
      "- The molecular functions assigned to each protein are consistent with their known activities\n",
      "- The subcellular localization of activities in the nucleus is correct and experimentally validated\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the finding that both SHMT1 and SHMT2 (specifically SHMT2alpha) contribute to nuclear de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, with SHMT2alpha providing redundancy that may account for the viability of Shmt1-/- mice.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "This model is scientifically accurate and follows most GO-CAM best practices. I recommend accepting the model with minor suggested improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider specifying the members of the ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase complex (GO:0005971) if known\n",
      "2. Add context about the cell cycle-dependence of this pathway\n",
      "3. Consider representing the SUMOylation of SHMT1, DHFR, and TYMS as this post-translational modification is critical for their nuclear localization\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality GO-CAM model that effectively represents the current understanding of the dTMP biosynthetic process in mice.\n",

      "\n",
      "[GO-CAM model 613aae0000000341](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:613aae0000000341) represents \"cobalamin transport 2, distribution to tissues (Mouse)\" in mouse (*Mus musculus*, NCBITaxon:10090). This model describes the process of cobalamin (vitamin B12) transport from the intestine to tissues through the bloodstream via cobalamin-binding proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four main proteins and their activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Abcc1/MRP1** (MGI:MGI:102676) - Enables ABC-type vitamin B12 transporter activity (GO:0015420)\n",
      "2. **Tcn2** (MGI:MGI:98534) - Enables both:\n",
      "   - Molecular carrier activity (GO:0140104)\n",
      "   - Cargo receptor ligand activity (GO:0140355)\n",

      "3. **Cd320** (MGI:MGI:1860083) - Enables cargo receptor activity (GO:0038024)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Causal Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents a sequential process of cobalamin transport with the following causal associations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Abcc1/MRP1 with ABC-type vitamin B12 transporter activity (GO:0015420) in the basal plasma membrane (GO:0009925) **provides input for** Tcn2's molecular carrier activity (GO:0140104) in extracellular space (GO:0005615).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Tcn2 with molecular carrier activity (GO:0140104) in extracellular space (GO:0005615) **directly positively regulates** Tcn2's cargo receptor ligand activity (GO:0140355) on the external side of plasma membrane (GO:0009897).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Tcn2 with cargo receptor ligand activity (GO:0140355) on the external side of plasma membrane (GO:0009897) **directly positively regulates** Cd320's cargo receptor activity (GO:0038024) on the plasma membrane (GO:0005886).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The molecular carrier activity of Tcn2 includes a nested activity of cobalamin binding (GO:0031419), connected through a BFO:0000051 relation (has_part).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is supported by several published studies:\n",
      "- PMID:19897579 - Identification of MRP1/ABCC1 as the transporter responsible for cellular export of cobalamin\n",
      "- PMID:23430977 - Transcobalamin receptor (Cd320) knockout mouse study\n",
      "- PMID:21655200 - Mouse transcobalamin features compared to human transcobalamin and haptocorrin\n",
      "- PMID:237480 - Transport of vitamin B12 into mouse leukemia cells\n",
      "\n",
      "## QC Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly represents the current understanding of cobalamin transport in mice, especially regarding:\n",
      "   - The role of MRP1/ABCC1 in exporting cobalamin from cells\n",
      "   - Tcn2 as the primary cobalamin binding protein in mouse (unlike humans who have both transcobalamin and haptocorrin)\n",
      "   - Cd320 as the receptor for Tcn2-cobalamin complex\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal flow**: The model has appropriate directional flow showing how cobalamin moves from cells to extracellular space and then is taken up by other cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cell locations**: Each activity is properly annotated with the appropriate cellular location.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence base**: All activities are supported by experimental evidence from mouse studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues/Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular carrier activity representation**: According to the \"Molecular_carrier_activity\" guidelines, the relation between a transported molecule (cobalamin) and its carrier (Tcn2) should be \"has input\" and \"has output\". While the model properly represents Tcn2's cobalamin binding activity as part of its molecular carrier activity, it might benefit from explicitly representing the cobalamin molecule as input and output.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complete pathway representation**: The model starts with the export of cobalamin from cells (via MRP1) but doesn't represent the initial uptake of dietary cobalamin. Consider expanding the model to include the intestinal absorption of cobalamin.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Part_of biological process annotation**: All activities are appropriately annotated as part_of the cobalamin transport process (GO:0015889), which is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, [GO-CAM model 613aae0000000341](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:613aae0000000341) is a well-constructed representation of cobalamin transport in mice. It accurately captures the molecular mechanisms of how cobalamin is exported from cells, bound by transcobalamin (Tcn2) in the extracellular space, and subsequently taken up by other cells through the Cd320 receptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively integrates information from several primary research papers and correctly represents the differences between mouse and human cobalamin transport (particularly that mice have Tcn2 but no haptocorrin). The causal connections between activities create a coherent biological story.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only minor suggestion would be to consider explicitly representing the cobalamin molecule as input and output in the carrier activity, as recommended in the molecular carrier activity guidelines. However, this doesn't detract from the overall quality and accuracy of the model.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:613aae0000000500) represents the \"cobalamin metabolic process 3, methylation of cobalamin\" pathway in mouse. It models the conversion of cobalamin (vitamin B12) to its active methylcobalamin form and its subsequent use in methionine synthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes five activities with the following gene products:\n",
      "1. MMACHC (MGI:MGI:1914346) - oxidoreductase activity\n",
      "2. MMADHC (MGI:MGI:1923786) - molecular carrier activity\n",

      "- MMADHC → MTR (methionine synthase) AND MTR (with cob(II)alamin output)\n",
      "- MTR (with cob(II)alamin output) → MTRR (methionine synthase reductase)\n",
      "- MTRR → MTR (methionine synthase)\n",
      "\n",
      "This represents a circular pathway where MTR activity produces cob(II)alamin, which is then a substrate for MTRR, which in turn produces methylcobalamin (CHEBI:28115) that enables the methionine synthase activity of MTR again.\n",

      "- MTRR regenerates the active methylcobalamin form when MTR's cobalamin cofactor becomes oxidized to cob(II)alamin\n",
      "\n",
      "The molecular species (CHEBI:28115, methylcobalamin; CHEBI:16304, cob(II)alamin) are appropriately included.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Appropriate use of causal relations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses the appropriate causal relations:\n",
      "- \"RO:0002413\" (provides input for) is used consistently to link activities in the pathway\n",
      "- The relations accurately reflect that each protein's activity provides input for the downstream protein's activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Cellular component annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes \"GO:0005829\" (cytosol) as the location for MMACHC and MMADHC activities, which is correct based on their known subcellular localization.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Use of evidence codes\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes:\n",
      "- ECO:0000266 (sequence orthology evidence used in manual assertion) - correctly used with human Uniprot IDs as with_objects\n",
      "- ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence used in manual assertion) - appropriately used with mouse genes\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Completeness of the model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model appears to include all the essential components of the methylcobalamin metabolic pathway. It correctly represents:\n",
      "- Initial processing of cobalamin by MMACHC/MMADHC\n",
      "- The role of methionine synthase (MTR)\n",
      "- The regeneration of the active methylcobalamin form by MTRR\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I recommend the following improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add cellular component annotation for MTRR and MTR**: Both activities should have \"occurs_in\" relationships with the cytosol (GO:0005829) as they are cytosolic proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify input/output relationships**: Add explicit \"has_input\" and \"has_output\" annotations for MMACHC to show what form of cobalamin it processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complete molecular details**: Consider adding the \"has_input\" relationship for MMADHC that would show it receives cobalamin from MMACHC.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add homocysteine and methionine molecules**: The model would benefit from including homocysteine as input and methionine as output for the MTR activity to complete the biochemical context.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider using a complex representation**: Since MMACHC and MMADHC are known to form a functional complex, as per the document \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\", this interaction could be represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Add additional evidence**: Some of the causal associations lack evidence annotations. Adding evidence for these relationships would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"cobalamin metabolic process 3, methylation of cobalamin (Mouse)\" (gomodel:613aae0000000500) is a well-constructed representation of vitamin B12 metabolism. It accurately captures the key activities and relationships in the methylcobalamin pathway and uses appropriate ontology terms and evidence codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is biologically accurate, following the known pathway where cobalamin is processed by MMACHC, transported by MMADHC, utilized by methionine synthase (MTR), and regenerated by methionine synthase reductase (MTRR). The circular nature of the pathway is correctly represented through the causal flow of activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the suggested minor improvements, particularly regarding cellular components and molecular inputs/outputs, the model would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important metabolic pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model (GO-CAM ID: [gomodel:613aae0000000579](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:613aae0000000579)) titled \"SP-ANN-TPPP\" represents interactions between various S100 calcium-binding proteins (S100B, S100A6, S100A2) and the Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP/p25), focusing on their role in regulating microtubule dynamics and organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents a regulatory pathway where multiple S100 proteins (S100B, S100A6, and S100A2) interact with TPPP/p25 to inhibit its dimerization activity, which in turn affects microtubule nucleation. The model includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Three S100 proteins (S100B, S100A6, S100A2) with protein binding activity (GO:0005515)\n",
      "2. TPPP/p25 with protein dimerization activity (GO:0046983) and microtubule nucleator activity (GO:0140490)\n",
      "3. Causal relationships where S100 proteins negatively regulate (RO:0002630, \"directly negatively regulates\") TPPP's dimerization activity\n",
      "4. TPPP's dimerization activity positively regulates (RO:0002629, \"directly positively regulates\") its own microtubule nucleator activity\n",
      "5. The microtubule nucleator activity occurs in the Golgi apparatus (GO:0005794)\n",
      "\n",
      "This pathway accurately represents the findings from the literature, particularly from the 2021 paper by Doi et al. (PMID: 33831707) which demonstrated that S100 proteins regulate TPPP activity by inhibiting its dimerization.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model cites appropriate evidence for its assertions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- TPPP's protein dimerization activity: ECO:0000314 (direct assay) from PMID:22484033\n",
      "- TPPP's microtubule nucleator activity: ECO:0000314 (direct assay) from PMID:31522887\n",
      "- S100 proteins' inhibition of TPPP dimerization: ECO:0000314 (direct assay) from PMID:33831707\n",
      "- TPPP's dimerization promoting microtubule nucleation: ECO:0000314 (direct assay) from PMID:22484033\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence aligns with current scientific understanding:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Olah et al. (2012) demonstrated that TPPP forms dimers that promote microtubule assembly\n",
      "2. Fu et al. (2019) showed that TPPP acts as a microtubule nucleator at Golgi outposts\n",
      "3. Doi et al. (2021) established that S100 proteins (S100B, S100A6, S100A2) directly bind to TPPP and inhibit its dimerization\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correct causal relationships**: The model appropriately uses \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630) for inhibitory relationships and \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) for activating relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper molecular function annotation**: The model correctly annotates TPPP with protein dimerization activity (GO:0046983) and microtubule nucleator activity (GO:0140490), and S100 proteins with protein binding activity (GO:0005515).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular location specification**: The model includes location information for the microtubule nucleator activity (Golgi apparatus).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence provenance**: All assertions include appropriate evidence codes and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complex representation**: According to the GO-CAM best practices document on complexes, when specific subunits carrying the activity are known, the activities are represented by the specific proteins. This model follows this guideline by showing TPPP's specific activities rather than using a generic complex term.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model generally follows best practices, a few minor improvements could be made:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **More specific protein binding terms for S100 proteins**: Instead of the general GO:0005515 (protein binding), more specific terms like \"S100 protein binding\" or \"calcium-dependent protein binding\" could better describe the molecular function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include calcium as a cofactor**: Since the regulation by S100 proteins is calcium-dependent, this information could be included in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include additional downstream effects**: The model could be expanded to show how TPPP's microtubule nucleation activity affects cellular processes like myelination, which is discussed in the Fu et al. (2019) paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional evidence for location**: While the Golgi apparatus location is appropriate based on Fu et al. (2019), adding this specific reference for this assertion would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the regulation of TPPP's microtubule nucleator activity by S100 proteins through inhibition of TPPP dimerization. The biological content is consistent with current literature, the evidence is appropriate, and the model follows GO-CAM best practices. Minor improvements could enhance its specificity and completeness, but overall, this is a well-constructed model that effectively captures this regulatory pathway.\n",

      "## Model Summary\n",
      "**ID**: [gomodel:613aae0000000813](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:613aae0000000813)  \n",
      "**Title**: Liver apoptosis regulation by CASP6 (Human)  \n",
      "**Taxon**: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)  \n",
      "**Status**: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the molecular pathway for CASP6 (Caspase-6) regulation in liver apoptosis, specifically focusing on how the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibits CASP6 activation to prevent excessive hepatocyte death in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The model is based primarily on research by Zhao et al. (2020) published in Science (PMID:32029622).\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains four key activities:\n",
      "1. BID (P55957-4) enabling cysteine-type endopeptidase regulator activity (GO:0043028)\n",
      "2. PRKAA1 (Q13131-2) enabling protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "3. PRKAA2 (P54646) enabling protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) \n",
      "4. CASP6 (P55212) enabling cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004197)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts the following regulatory pathway:\n",
      "- Both PRKAA1 and PRKAA2 (AMPK α1 and α2 subunits) negatively regulate CASP6 through their protein serine/threonine kinase activity\n",
      "- CASP6, when active, positively regulates BID through its cysteine-type endopeptidase activity\n",
      "- BID, when cleaved by CASP6, participates in positive regulation of cytochrome c release from mitochondria\n",
      "\n",
      "This pathway accurately reflects findings from Zhao et al. (2020), showing that:\n",
      "1. AMPK phosphorylates CASP6 at Ser-257, preventing its activation\n",
      "2. When AMPK activity is reduced (as in NASH), CASP6 becomes activated\n",
      "3. Active CASP6 cleaves BID to induce cytochrome c release\n",
      "4. This creates a feedforward loop that leads to hepatocyte death\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by evidence:\n",
      "- The relationship between CASP6 and BID is supported by experimental evidence from PMID:15661737 and PMID:32029622\n",
      "- The regulatory relationships between AMPK (PRKAA1/PRKAA2) and CASP6 are supported by experimental evidence from PMID:32029622\n",
      "- The biological processes (hepatocyte apoptotic process, release of cytochrome c) are well-supported by experimental evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence types used (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence, ECO:0000304 - author statement supported by traceable reference) are appropriate for the assertions made.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "- Appropriate use of causal relationships (RO:0002630 \"directly negatively regulates\" and RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\")\n",
      "- Correct representation of protein activities and biological processes\n",
      "- Proper association of activities with biological processes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Current Knowledge\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with current understanding of AMPK-CASP6 regulation in liver damage. Zhao et al. (2020) demonstrated that:\n",
      "1. AMPK phosphorylates CASP6 at Ser-257, preventing its activation\n",
      "2. In NASH, reduced AMPK activity leads to increased CASP6 activation\n",
      "3. CASP6 cleaves BID at specific sites (Asp59 and Asp75)\n",
      "4. Cleaved BID induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures this mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recent Changes and Annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes an automated change from 2024-10-10 where GO:0097153 was replaced by GO:0004197 (cysteine-type endopeptidase activity), reflecting ongoing ontology maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I suggest the following improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add molecular details of phosphorylation**: The model could be enhanced by specifically indicating that AMPK phosphorylates CASP6 at Ser-257. This detail is crucial for understanding the mechanism and is well-supported by the Zhao et al. paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include the feedback loop**: The model shows CASP6 cleaving BID, but doesn't fully capture the feedforward loop described in the paper where cleaved BID induces cytochrome c release, which further activates upstream caspases. This feedback mechanism is an important aspect of how CASP6 sustains apoptosis in hepatocytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add additional molecular players**: The model could include other components mentioned in the paper, such as:\n",
      "   - Executioner caspases (CASP3 and CASP7) that initially cleave CASP6\n",
      "   - Cytochrome c and its role in activating the caspase cascade\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarify BID cleavage sites**: The model could specify the cleavage sites on BID (Asp59 and Asp75) as these are specifically identified in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Update GO term for BID**: BID's activity is currently annotated as \"cysteine-type endopeptidase regulator activity involved in apoptotic process\" (GO:0043028), but based on the paper, it might be more appropriate to use \"BH3 domain binding\" or \"pro-apoptotic activity\" as BID acts as a BH3-only protein that promotes apoptosis after being cleaved.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Liver apoptosis regulation by CASP6 (Human)\" effectively represents the key molecular interactions in the AMPK-CASP6-BID pathway involved in liver damage during NASH. It is well-supported by published evidence and follows GO-CAM best practices. With the suggested enhancements, the model could more comprehensively capture the molecular details and feedback mechanisms involved in this important pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model makes a valuable contribution to understanding how metabolic dysregulation in NASH leads to increased hepatocyte apoptosis through the AMPK-CASP6 axis, which has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for NASH treatment.\n",

      "   - The model uses Q92889-2 (ERCC4/XPF) for both protein binding and endonuclease activity, but the paper emphasizes that these activities are performed by the XPF-ERCC1 complex.\n",
      "   - Per the GO-CAM \"How to annotate complexes\" guideline, if the activity is specifically carried out by the complex rather than individual subunits, it would be better to use the complex ID (GO:0070522 \"ERCC4-ERCC1 complex\") to represent the endonuclease activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Components**:\n",
      "   - While ERCC1 (UniProtKB:P07992) is listed in the objects of the model, it's not explicitly represented in the activities. Given the paper's emphasis on the importance of XPF-ERCC1 interaction for activity, it would be beneficial to represent ERCC1 more explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Activity Annotation Specificity**:\n",
      "   - The use of generic \"protein binding\" (GO:0005515) for XPF could be more specific, such as \"protein complex binding\" or even more specifically \"ERCC1 binding\" if such a term exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological Context Expansion**:\n",
      "   - The model could potentially include that TIP60 acetylation of XPF is induced by DNA damage (UV irradiation or MMC treatment), providing additional contextual information.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider using GO:0070522 (ERCC4-ERCC1 complex) as the entity for the endonuclease activity rather than just XPF protein, as the paper clearly shows this activity requires the complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add a representation of ERCC1's role in the complex, potentially showing it as part of the functional unit with XPF.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Replace the generic \"protein binding\" term with a more specific term that better describes the XPF-ERCC1 interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Potentially expand the model to include the DNA damage context that induces TIP60 activation and subsequent XPF acetylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-structured model that captures the key findings from the paper regarding KAT5/TIP60's role in nucleotide excision repair through XPF acetylation. With minor adjustments to better represent the complex nature of the XPF-ERCC1 interaction, this model would provide an excellent representation of the biological pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Contents\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the regulatory mechanism of KAT5 (Histone acetyltransferase KAT5/TIP60) involving autoacetylation and deacetylation by HDAC3 and SIRT1. The model includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **KAT5 autoacetylation**: KAT5 ([UniProtKB:Q92993](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q92993)) has peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity (GO:0061733) that directly positively regulates its own histone acetyltransferase activity (GO:0004402)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **KAT5 deacetylation by HDAC3**: HDAC3 ([UniProtKB:O15379](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:O15379)) has protein lysine deacetylase activity (GO:0033558) that directly negatively regulates KAT5's peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **KAT5 deacetylation by SIRT1**: SIRT1 ([UniProtKB:Q96EB6](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q96EB6)) has NAD-dependent protein lysine deacetylase activity (GO:0034979) that directly negatively regulates KAT5's peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological context**: All activities are part of DNA repair-dependent chromatin remodeling (GO:0140861)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "The model accurately represents the biological process described in the literature. According to the referenced papers (PMID:25301942 and PMID:20100829), KAT5 undergoes autoacetylation which enhances its activity, while both HDAC3 and SIRT1 can deacetylate KAT5, reducing its activity. The subcellular location (nucleus) is correctly specified for the relevant activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Structure Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Proper use of causal relationships**: The model correctly uses \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) and \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630) to connect the activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate molecular functions**: The model uses specific molecular functions for each protein:\n",
      "   - KAT5: peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity (GO:0061733) and histone acetyltransferase activity (GO:0004402)\n",
      "   - HDAC3: protein lysine deacetylase activity (GO:0033558)\n",
      "   - SIRT1: NAD-dependent protein lysine deacetylase activity (GO:0034979)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clear biological context**: All activities are properly situated within DNA repair-dependent chromatin remodeling (GO:0140861)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence and references**: Each activity has appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) with corresponding literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "1. **Missing evidence for one causal association**: The causal association between HDAC3's protein lysine deacetylase activity and KAT5's peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity lacks evidence codes and references. This should be added for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Protein complex representation**: While not necessarily an issue in this case, the model doesn't explicitly represent KAT5 as part of any complexes it might function in. According to UniProt records, KAT5 is part of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, but since the model focuses on KAT5 regulation rather than its downstream targets, this representation is acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Add evidence for HDAC3's regulatory relationship**: Add appropriate evidence codes and references for the causal association between HDAC3's deacetylase activity and KAT5's acetyltransferase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider expanding the model**: While the current model is coherent and focused, it could potentially be expanded to include:\n",
      "   - The specific lysine residues on KAT5 that are acetylated/deacetylated (e.g., Lys-104, Lys-120, Lys-148, Lys-150, Lys-187, and Lys-189 as mentioned in the UniProt entry)\n",
      "   - Downstream effects of KAT5 acetylation/deacetylation on its target proteins or biological processes\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consistency check**: Verify that the temporal relationships in the model are accurate - autoacetylation occurs first, followed by its effect on KAT5's acetyltransferase activity, which can be regulated by HDAC3 and SIRT1's deacetylase activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "This is a high-quality GO-CAM model that effectively represents the regulatory mechanism of KAT5 through autoacetylation and deacetylation by HDAC3 and SIRT1. The model adheres to GO-CAM annotation guidelines, uses appropriate terms and relationships, and is supported by literature evidence. With the minor addition of evidence for one causal association, the model would be complete and ready for continued use in production.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in mouse. The model contains 4 activities involving:\n",

      "## Assessment of Model Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly follows the GO-CAM representation of a receptor-ligand signaling pathway according to guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper causal relations**:\n",
      "   - Metallopeptidases (Mep1a and Adam10) properly connect to EGF with `RO:0002304` (causally upstream of, positive effect)\n",
      "   - EGF properly connects to EGFR with `RO:0002629` (directly positively regulates)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate cellular context**:\n",
      "   - Metallopeptidases and EGFR occur in plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",

      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses several sources of evidence:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Experimental Evidence**:\n",
      "   - ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "   - ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "   - ECO:0000266 (sequence orthology evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Literature Support**:\n",
      "   - PMID:22923609 - Shows Meprin α can shed EGF, activate EGFR pathway\n",
      "   - PMID:6248866 - Early study showing EGF-receptor binding in embryonic tissues\n",

      "\n",
      "The evidence from PMID:22923609 strongly supports the role of meprin α (Mep1a) in the shedding of EGF and TGF-α, leading to EGFR activation. This paper demonstrates that meprin α directly cleaves EGF precursors, resulting in EGFR pathway activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of the EGFR signaling pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Role of Metallopeptidases**: The inclusion of metallopeptidases (Mep1a and Adam10) in EGF ligand maturation is well-supported by the evidence. From PMID:22923609, we learn that Meprin α can shed EGF from the plasma membrane, contributing to EGFR activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **EGFR Signaling**: The pathway correctly shows how mature EGF activates EGFR through direct positive regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Locations**: The cellular locations of components are biologically accurate, with the receptor and metallopeptidases at the plasma membrane and the ligand in extracellular space.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for signaling receptor pathways:\n",

      "1. **Ligand Representation**: EGF is correctly annotated with receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018) in extracellular space.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Receptor Representation**: EGFR is correctly annotated with EGF receptor activity (GO:0005006) at the plasma membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Relations**: The model uses appropriate causal relations:\n",
      "   - Metallopeptidases → EGF: causally upstream of, positive effect\n",
      "   - EGF → EGFR: directly positively regulates\n",

      "## Potential Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is structurally sound and biologically accurate, I would suggest the following improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Downstream Signaling**: The model could be expanded to include downstream effectors of EGFR activation, such as the RAS-MAPK pathway and PI3K-AKT pathway, which are well-established components of EGFR signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regulation Mechanisms**: Addition of negative regulators of the pathway, such as phosphatases that dephosphorylate EGFR, would provide a more complete picture of pathway regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback Loops**: Including feedback mechanisms that downregulate receptor signaling would enhance the model's completeness.\n",

      "### Automated Changes\n",
      "The model shows the following automated changes:\n",
      "- \"RO:0002212 replaced by RO:0002630\" (2023-03-16)\n",
      "- \"RO:0002213 replaced by RO:0002629\" (2023-03-16)\n",
      "\n",
      "These changes updated the relation terms to use the more specific \"directly positively/negatively regulates\" predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment and QC\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Content Consistency\n",
      "The model represents a well-substantiated pathway based on research published in PMID:30773093 and PMID:22492721. The model captures how:\n",
      "1. DYRK1A phosphorylates RNF169 (in response to DNA damage)\n",
      "2. This phosphorylation enhances RNF169's ability to bind to ubiquitylated histones at DNA damage sites\n",
      "3. RNF169 then competes with and inhibits TP53BP1 and UIMC1/RAP80 from binding to the same modified chromatin\n",
      "4. This competition influences the choice between homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathways\n",
      "\n",
      "The papers clearly support that RNF169 functions in homologous recombination (HR) repair, while TP53BP1 and UIMC1/RAP80 promote non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several ways:\n",
      "1. Each activity is enabled by a single gene product\n",
      "2. Causal connections use appropriate relation terms (directly positively/negatively regulates)\n",
      "3. Activities are properly contextualized with subcellular location (site of double-strand break)\n",
      "4. Activities are appropriately linked to biological processes (different DNA repair pathways)\n",
      "5. Evidence codes and references are properly included\n",
      "\n",
      "### Opportunities for Improvement\n",
      "While the model is scientifically accurate and well-structured, I suggest a few improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Completeness**: The model could be expanded to include:\n",
      "   - The mechanism by which DYRK1A is activated in response to DNA damage\n",
      "   - The specific phosphorylation sites on RNF169 (S368 and S403) mentioned in PMID:30773093\n",
      "   - The downstream effects of pathway choice (HR vs. NHEJ) on DNA repair outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Activity Annotation**: \n",
      "   - DYRK1A is annotated with \"protein serine kinase activity\" which is appropriate, but could be more specifically annotated with \"protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity\" (GO:0004712) based on UniProt annotation, though this may be less relevant for this specific context.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Parsimoniousness and Readability\n",
      "The model is parsimonious and readable. It clearly illustrates the competition between RNF169 and both TP53BP1 and UIMC1/RAP80 for binding to ubiquitylated histones at DNA damage sites, which is the key regulatory mechanism described in the underlying literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:617b481400003575) accurately represents the pathway described in the literature where DYRK1A phosphorylates RNF169 to enhance its ability to compete with TP53BP1 and UIMC1/RAP80 for binding to ubiquitylated histones at DNA damage sites, thereby influencing DNA repair pathway choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices, uses appropriate GO terms, relations, and evidence codes, and effectively captures the biological mechanism described in the literature. While there are minor opportunities for expansion, the model is scientifically accurate, well-structured, and parsimonious.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Summary of the Model\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in mouse, focusing on a specific signaling cascade from the ligand TGF-alpha through EGFR and downstream adaptor proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Components\n",
      "The model consists of the following key molecular functions and their associated gene products:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **TGF-alpha (MGI:MGI:98724)** - Performs \"receptor ligand activity\" (GO:0048018) in the extracellular space (GO:0005615).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **EGFR (MGI:MGI:95294)** - Has dual functionalities in the model:\n",
      "   - Performs \"epidermal growth factor receptor activity\" (GO:0005006) in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - Performs \"protein tyrosine kinase activity\" (GO:0004713) in the cell cortex (GO:0005938)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Grb2 (MGI:MGI:95805)** - Performs \"transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase adaptor activity\" (GO:0005068) in the cell cortex (GO:0005938)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Gab1 (MGI:MGI:108088)** - Performs \"signaling adaptor activity\" (GO:0035591) in the cell cortex (GO:0005938)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ptpn11/SHP2 (MGI:MGI:99511)** - Performs \"non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine phosphatase activity\" (GO:0004726) in the cytosol (GO:0005829)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "The model illustrates a signal transduction cascade with the following causal relationships:\n",
      "1. TGF-alpha → directly positively regulates → EGFR receptor activity\n",
      "2. EGFR receptor activity → directly positively regulates → Grb2 adaptor activity\n",
      "3. Grb2 → provides input for → EGFR kinase activity\n",
      "4. EGFR kinase activity → directly positively regulates → Gab1 adaptor activity\n",
      "5. Gab1 → directly positively regulates → Ptpn11/SHP2 phosphatase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Support\n",
      "The model is supported by several publications, including PMID:7678348, PMID:17881575, and PMID:9890893, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Review Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Content Consistency\n",
      "The represented EGFR signaling pathway aligns well with established knowledge of this pathway:\n",
      "1. The model correctly shows TGF-alpha as a ligand for EGFR, activating its receptor function\n",
      "2. It accurately represents EGFR's dual roles as a receptor and a kinase\n",
      "3. The adapter protein cascade involving Grb2, Gab1, and the phosphatase Ptpn11/SHP2 is consistent with the literature on EGFR signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "#### ✓ Signaling Receptor Activity Annotation:\n",
      "The model follows the guidelines for annotating signaling receptor activity:\n",
      "- TGF-alpha is correctly annotated with receptor ligand activity in the extracellular space\n",
      "- EGFR is annotated with receptor activity in the plasma membrane\n",
      "- The causal relationship between ligand and receptor uses \"directly positively regulates\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### ✓ Activity Flow:\n",
      "The activity flow in the pathway is logical and follows the expected pattern of EGFR signaling:\n",
      "1. Ligand binding → receptor activation → adaptor recruitment → signal transduction\n",
      "\n",
      "#### ✓ Cellular Compartments:\n",
      "The cellular locations are properly specified:\n",
      "- TGF-alpha in extracellular space\n",
      "- EGFR in plasma membrane and cell cortex\n",
      "- Adaptor proteins in appropriate cellular locations\n",
      "\n",
      "#### ✓ Evidence:\n",
      "Each activity and relationship is backed by appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Minor Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **EGFR Compartmentalization**: While the model shows EGFR kinase activity in the cell cortex, it may be worth noting that EGFR can also undergo endocytosis and signaling from endosomes. This additional compartmentalization could potentially be included in a more comprehensive model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Downstream Effectors**: The current model ends with Ptpn11/SHP2 activity. In the broader EGFR pathway, SHP2 typically leads to activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Extending the model to include these downstream effectors would provide a more complete representation of EGFR signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cross-talk with Other Pathways**: EGFR signaling often intersects with other signaling pathways. While this model focuses on one specific branch, acknowledging these connections could enhance its biological relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:61e0e55600000239 is a well-constructed representation of the EGFR signaling pathway in mouse. It adheres to GO-CAM curation best practices and accurately represents the biology of EGFR signaling as documented in the literature. The causal relationships between molecular functions are clearly defined, and each activity is properly contextualized with cellular locations and biological process involvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could potentially be expanded to include additional downstream events or cross-talk with other pathways, but as a focused representation of the core EGFR signaling cascade, it is accurate and valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this model can be considered a high-quality contribution to the GO-CAM database that effectively captures key aspects of EGFR signaling.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on my review of the model and the relevant literature, I'm ready to provide a thorough assessment of this GO-CAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Overview:\n",
      "This model represents the regulatory pathway by which SIRT6, FOXO1, and KAT2A/GCN5 interact to regulate gluconeogenesis in the human liver. The model consists of 6 molecular activities connected by causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Strengths:\n",
      "1. The model correctly represents the key molecular functions of the main players:\n",
      "   - SIRT6 (Q8N6T7) with NAD-dependent protein lysine deacetylase activity (GO:0034979)\n",
      "   - FOXO1 (Q12778) with DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700)\n",
      "   - KAT2A/GCN5 (Q92830) with peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity (GO:0061733)\n",
      "   - PPARGC1A (Q9UBK2) with transcription coactivator activity (GO:0003713)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The model correctly places all activities in the nucleus (GO:0005634), which matches the subcellular localization information from UniProt.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The model correctly connects the activities with causal relationships that are supported by the literature:\n",
      "   - SIRT6 directly negatively regulates FOXO1 (supported by PMID:25009184)\n",
      "   - SIRT6 directly positively regulates KAT2A (supported by PMID:23142079)\n",
      "   - KAT2A directly negatively regulates PPARGC1A (supported by PMID:23142079, PMID:16753578)\n",
      "   - FOXO1 directly positively regulates PPARGC1A (supported by references)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The biological process annotations are appropriate:\n",
      "   - SIRT6 activities are associated with negative regulation of gluconeogenesis (GO:0045721)\n",
      "   - FOXO1 activity is associated with positive regulation of gluconeogenesis (GO:0045722)\n",
      "   - PPARGC1A activity is associated with gluconeogenesis (GO:0006094)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Mechanistic Details**: The model could be more explicit about the specific mechanisms:\n",
      "   - SIRT6 deacetylates FOXO1, leading to its nuclear exclusion (PMID:25009184)\n",
      "   - SIRT6 specifically deacetylates KAT2A at Lys-549, which enhances KAT2A's acetyltransferase activity (PMID:23142079)\n",
      "   - KAT2A then acetylates PPARGC1A, which inhibits its transcriptional coactivator activity (PMID:16753578, PMID:23142079)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Potential Missing Activities**: \n",
      "   - The model doesn't include SIRT1, which was shown in the literature (PMID:23142079) to have opposing effects to SIRT6 on PPARGC1A acetylation and could be relevant for a complete understanding of the pathway.\n",
      "   - The model doesn't represent the positive regulation of SIRT6 by p53 as described in PMID:25009184, though this may be outside the specific scope of this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological Process Association for KAT2A**: \n",
      "   - Although KAT2A's activity is correctly associated with negative regulation of gluconeogenesis (GO:0045721), this connection could be strengthened by explicitly showing how KAT2A's acetylation of PPARGC1A leads to suppression of gluconeogenic genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional Evidence**: \n",
      "   - The model would benefit from citing PMID:25009184 as evidence for the relationship between SIRT6 and FOXO1, as this is a key paper establishing this connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggested Specific Improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add molecular details to the causal relationships**:\n",
      "   - SIRT6 → FOXO1: Add that SIRT6 deacetylates FOXO1 at Lys-423, promoting its nuclear exclusion\n",
      "   - SIRT6 → KAT2A: Add that SIRT6 deacetylates KAT2A at Lys-549\n",
      "   - KAT2A → PPARGC1A: Add that KAT2A acetylates PPARGC1A at multiple lysine residues\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider adding SIRT1** as a counterpart to SIRT6 in the regulation of PPARGC1A, showing its opposing effect (deacetylating PPARGC1A), which would provide a more complete picture of the regulatory circuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add downstream effects**: The model could be extended to show the downstream effects on specific gluconeogenic genes (G6PC and PCK1) that are regulated by PPARGC1A and FOXO1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Overall, gomodel:61f34dd300000981 is a well-constructed model that accurately represents the key molecular activities and causal relationships involved in the regulation of gluconeogenesis by SIRT6, FOXO1, and KAT2A/GCN5. The model is consistent with the literature and reflects the current understanding of this regulatory pathway. The suggested improvements would add more mechanistic detail and provide a more complete representation of the regulatory circuit, but the existing model is scientifically accurate and appropriately structured according to GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively illustrates how SIRT6 can suppress gluconeogenesis through two complementary mechanisms: (1) by directly promoting FOXO1 nuclear exclusion and (2) by activating KAT2A to acetylate and inhibit PPARGC1A. This dual mechanism provides robust regulation of the gluconeogenic program in the liver.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (ID [622aace900001389](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:622aace900001389)) represents the pentose-phosphate shunt (or pentose phosphate pathway) in mouse. The model focuses on three key enzymatic activities and their connections within this pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ribokinase activity (RBKS/MGI:MGI:1918586)\n",
      "2. Transketolase activity (TKT/MGI:MGI:105992)\n",
      "3. Transaldolase activity (TALDO1/MGI:MGI:1274789)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents the following sequence of activities:\n",
      "- Ribokinase (RBKS) phosphorylates D-ribose → provides input for Transketolase (TKT)\n",
      "- TKT converts sugars in the pathway → provides input for Transaldolase (TALDO1)\n",
      "- TALDO1 carries out transaldolase activity → generates more sugar intermediates\n",
      "- Another instance of TKT activity produces final outputs of the pathway\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities occur in the cytosol (GO:0005829) and are part of the pentose-phosphate shunt biological process (GO:0006098).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation of Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by experimental evidence:\n",
      "- All molecular functions are backed by direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314)\n",
      "- The final outputs of the pathway (CHEBI:57634 - β-D-fructofuranose 6-phosphate and CHEBI:59776 - D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) are properly annotated\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "1. The model correctly represents the flow of activities in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway\n",
      "2. Each activity is properly annotated with appropriate molecular functions and cellular locations\n",
      "3. All activities are connected using the appropriate causal relationship (RO:0002413 \"provides input for\")\n",
      "4. The evidence is from primary literature with appropriate citations (PMID:5360673, PMID:13405914)\n",
      "5. The outputs of the pathway are properly defined chemical entities\n",
      "\n",
      "**Issues for improvement:**\n",
      "1. **Missing input molecules:** While the model shows D-ribose (CHEBI:47013) as input for the first reaction, it does not explicitly show all inputs for each reaction step. For completeness, it would be beneficial to include all substrate molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Limited scope:** The model only covers part of the pentose phosphate pathway. It focuses on the non-oxidative branch (starting with ribose) but doesn't include the oxidative branch starting with glucose-6-phosphate. A more comprehensive model would include both branches.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing ATP as cofactor:** The ribokinase activity requires ATP as a cofactor, which is not explicitly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Incomplete reaction details:** While the final products are shown for one transketolase reaction, similar details for intermediate reactions would strengthen the model's completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Coherence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the biological process as described in the literature. The pentose phosphate pathway includes both oxidative and non-oxidative branches, and this model focuses primarily on the non-oxidative branch, starting with ribokinase activity on D-ribose. The sequence of activities (ribokinase → transketolase → transaldolase → transketolase) is consistent with our understanding of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the literature on the pentose phosphate pathway, transketolase and transaldolase are indeed the key enzymes of the non-oxidative branch that interconvert various sugar phosphates. The model correctly represents this, with transketolase shown to have specific output molecules in the final step.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "1. Activities are connected appropriately using the \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) causal relation\n",
      "2. Each activity is properly associated with a gene product\n",
      "3. Each activity occurs in the appropriate cellular compartment (cytosol)\n",
      "4. All activities are part of the correct biological process (pentose-phosphate shunt)\n",
      "5. Evidence is provided for assertions with appropriate ECO codes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model 622aace900001389 presents a clear and accurate representation of part of the pentose phosphate pathway in mouse, focusing on the non-oxidative branch. The model is well-structured and properly annotated with appropriate molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "For future enhancement, the model could be expanded to include:\n",
      "1. The oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway\n",
      "2. More detailed representation of all inputs and outputs for each reaction\n",
      "3. Explicit representation of cofactors like ATP for ribokinase\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality model that provides valuable information about the pentose phosphate pathway in mouse and follows GO-CAM best practices.\n",

      "Based on my review of the GO-CAM model (gomodel:6246724f00001700) and the GO-CAM guidelines, here's my evaluation:\n",
      "\n",
      "# GO-CAM Review: Hyaluronan catabolic process (Mouse) [gomodel:6246724f00001700](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6246724f00001700)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "This model represents the hyaluronan catabolic process in mice, showing the molecular activities involved in hyaluronan degradation from receptor-mediated endocytosis through lysosomal degradation. The model appears to be well-constructed and evidence-based, with appropriate use of causal relationships between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model effectively captures the entire process from receptor binding of hyaluronan at the cell surface through transport into lysosomes and subsequent degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-evidenced annotations**: Each activity is supported by appropriate evidence codes and literature references, using a combination of direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314), mutant phenotype evidence (ECO:0000315), and sequence orthology evidence (ECO:0000266).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate cellular localization**: The model correctly represents the spatial organization of the pathway, with hyaluronan receptors in membrane rafts (GO:0045121) and degradative enzymes in lysosomes (GO:0005764).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Logical causal flow**: The causal relationships (RO:0002413 \"provides input for\" and RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\") are used appropriately to connect activities in a biologically meaningful sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Issues and Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing annotation**: The activity gomodel:6246724f00001700/6246724f00001716 (Stab2-enabled receptor activity) is annotated as part of \"receptor-mediated endocytosis\" (GO:0006898) rather than the overall \"hyaluronan catabolic process\" (GO:0030214) like most other activities. Consider whether this is intentional or if it should be updated for consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete cellular component annotations**: Some activities, particularly those related to receptor-mediated endocytosis (e.g., gomodel:6246724f00001700/6246724f00001707 for Hmmr), lack \"occurs_in\" evidence even though they are annotated to occur in membrane rafts (GO:0045121). Adding supporting evidence would strengthen these annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Automated predicate change note**: There's a comment noting \"Automated change 2023-03-16: RO:0002213 replaced by RO:0002629.\" This is appropriate as it reflects the updated ontology term usage for direct positive regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological content appears accurate and supported by the cited literature. The model shows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Four receptors (CD44, HMMR, LYVE1, STAB2) mediating hyaluronan endocytosis\n",
      "2. Sodium/proton exchangers (SLC9A1, CHP1) regulating HYAL2 activity\n",
      "3. Sequential degradation of hyaluronan by:\n",
      "   - HYAL2 (initial degradation)\n",
      "   - HYAL1 (further degradation in lysosomes)\n",
      "   - GUSB (beta-glucuronidase activity)\n",
      "   - HEXA/HEXB (beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity)\n",
      "4. Appropriate transport mechanisms (SLC17A5 for glucuronate transport)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider adding references to some of the causal relationships that lack evidence annotations (many of the RO:0002413 \"provides input for\" relationships).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Review the part_of relationship for Stab2 (MGI:MGI:2178743) to determine if it should also be part of GO:0030214 rather than only GO:0006898.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Consider adding evidence for the \"occurs_in\" relationships that are currently lacking evidence codes, particularly for the receptor activities in membrane rafts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that effectively represents the hyaluronan catabolic process in mice with strong evidence support and appropriate causal relationships between activities.\n",

      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: IL9-mediated signaling pathway (Human)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (ID: [gomodel:626b20c100000025](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:626b20c100000025)) represents the IL9-mediated signaling pathway in humans. The model depicts the cascade from IL9 cytokine binding to its receptor through to the activation of STAT transcription factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pathway Completeness**: The model properly captures the major components of the IL9 signaling pathway, from the extracellular ligand (IL9) to the downstream transcription factors (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper Cellular Localization**: Each protein is appropriately localized in cellular compartments consistent with their biological roles:\n",
      "   - IL9 in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "   - Receptors (IL9R, IL2RG) in plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - JAK kinases at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (GO:0031234) \n",
      "   - STAT proteins in the nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate Causal Relationships**: The model uses correct causal predicates (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\") to connect activities in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistent with Literature**: The pathway depicted is supported by the referenced literature, with each component and relationship having evidence from publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **STAT Transcription Factor Activities**: The STAT proteins (STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5A) are annotated with DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700), but according to the guidelines, more specific child terms should be used:\n",
      "   - DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific (GO:0001228)\n",
      "   - DNA-binding transcription repressor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific (GO:0001227)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Transcriptional Targets**: The STAT transcription factors don't have any specified transcriptional targets (missing \"has input\" relationship). According to the DNA-binding transcription factor activity annotation guidelines, each transcription factor should specify the genes it regulates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Gap**: Some associations lack evidence annotations:\n",
      "   - STAT5A (P42229) occurs_in nucleus (GO:0005634) is missing evidence\n",
      "   - There are no causal associations from STAT transcription factors to their downstream targets\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **JAK3 to STAT5A Connection**: The model shows JAK3 directly regulating STAT5A, but the evidence for this is cited as PMID:10919676. I couldn't verify this specific interaction from the available information.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Protein-Protein Interactions**: While the model represents the signaling flow correctly, it might benefit from explicitly modeling the important protein-protein interactions, such as the IL9R-IL2RG complex formation that's crucial for signal transduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological pathway depicted is consistent with current understanding of IL9 signaling:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cytokine-Receptor Binding**: IL9 (P15248) correctly binds to and activates IL9R (Q01113), which is supported by PMID:8193355.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Co-receptor Activity**: The model properly includes IL2RG (common gamma chain) as a co-receptor, which is essential for IL9 signaling, supported by PMID:18829468.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **JAK-STAT Pathway**: The activation of JAK1/JAK3 kinases leading to STAT phosphorylation and nuclear translocation follows the established mechanism of cytokine receptor signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Multiple STAT Activation**: The model correctly shows that IL9 signaling activates multiple STAT proteins (STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5A), which is consistent with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",

      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: IL10-mediated signaling pathway (Human)\n",
      "**Model ID**: [gomodel:626b20c100000681](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:626b20c100000681)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This model represents the IL10-mediated signaling pathway in humans and includes a cascade of molecular interactions starting from IL10 secretion through receptor binding and downstream signaling via JAK1, TYK2, and culminating in STAT3 transcription factor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following main components:\n",
      "1. **IL10 (P22301)** as the cytokine ligand\n",
      "2. **IL10RA (Q13651)** as the primary receptor\n",
      "3. **IL10RB (Q08334)** as the co-receptor\n",
      "4. **JAK1 (P23458)** and **TYK2 (P29597)** as the receptor-associated kinases\n",
      "5. **STAT3 (P40763)** as the downstream transcription factor\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate Ligand Representation**: IL10 is correctly modeled with cytokine activity (GO:0005125) occurring in extracellular space (GO:0005615) and part of the IL10-mediated signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper Receptor Complex**: The model accurately represents both IL10RA (primary receptor) and IL10RB (co-receptor) in the plasma membrane, which aligns with known biology and the Signaling Receptor Activity annotation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate Causal Relationships**: The model correctly uses \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) to connect the signaling cascade from ligand to receptor, receptor to co-receptor, and through to downstream components.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological Process Context**: All activities are properly part of the IL10-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0140105), providing consistent biological context.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cellular Compartments**: The model correctly specifies the cellular location for each activity (extracellular space for IL10, plasma membrane for receptors, and nucleus for STAT3).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Protein Phosphorylation**: The model indicates that JAK1 and TYK2 have protein tyrosine kinase activity, but does not explicitly show which proteins they phosphorylate. Based on the literature, JAK1 should phosphorylate STAT3, but this relationship isn't clearly indicated in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete Signaling Cascade**: The model shows STAT3 as a DNA-binding transcription factor but doesn't indicate what genes it regulates downstream. This makes the model somewhat incomplete from a functional perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Receptor Input Specification**: According to the signaling receptor activity guidelines, the receptor's input should be the effector protein it regulates (not the ligand). In this model, explicit \"has input\" relationships would improve clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence Base**: The model relies primarily on two papers (PMID:16982608 and PMID:7543512) for most assertions. While these are appropriate, a broader evidence base would strengthen the model's robustness.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the canonical IL10 signaling pathway as described in the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. IL10 binds to IL10RA, which is consistent with the function of IL10 as an anti-inflammatory cytokine that signals through its receptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. IL10RA activates IL10RB, forming a receptor heterocomplex, which is biologically accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The receptor complex activates JAK1 and TYK2 kinases, which is consistent with the established signaling mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. STAT3 activation and translocation to the nucleus for transcriptional regulation is the expected outcome of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the known biology of IL10 as described in UniProt: \"IL10 binds to its heterotetrameric receptor comprising IL10RA and IL10RB leading to JAK1 and STAT2-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3. In turn, STAT3 translocates to the nucleus where it drives expression of anti-inflammatory mediators.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signaling Receptor Guidelines**: The receptor-ligand relationships follow the guidelines for protein ligand-activated signaling receptors, with the cytokine properly activating the receptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Relationships**: The use of \"directly positively regulates\" is appropriate for the signaling cascade represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Context**: Each activity has appropriate cellular compartment annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Phosphorylation Targets**: Explicitly show that JAK1 phosphorylates STAT3, using an appropriate causal relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expand Downstream Effects**: Include information about what genes STAT3 regulates to provide a more complete picture of the pathway's functional outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clarify Input Relationships**: According to GO-CAM guidelines, explicitly add \"has input\" relationships between receptors and their effector proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Include Additional Evidence**: Consider incorporating additional supporting literature, especially for the effects of STAT3 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:626b20c100000681 provides a reasonably accurate representation of the IL10-mediated signaling pathway in humans. It follows most GO-CAM best practices and captures key molecular interactions in the pathway. With the suggested improvements, particularly in detailing the downstream effects of STAT3 activation and explicit representation of phosphorylation targets, the model would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important anti-inflammatory signaling pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:627d95ee00001943](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:627d95ee00001943)) titled \"Activation of PARP1 activity by HPF1 during DNA repair (Human)\" represents the molecular interactions between PARP1 (Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) and HPF1 (Histone PARylation factor 1) during DNA repair processes in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following key proteins and their activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **PARP1 (UniProtKB:P09874)** with multiple molecular functions:\n",
      "   - Damaged DNA binding (GO:0003684)\n",
      "   - Protein homodimerization activity (GO:0042803)\n",
      "   - NAD+-protein-serine ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (GO:0140805)\n",
      "   - NAD+-protein poly-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (GO:0003950)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **HPF1 (UniProtKB:Q9NWY4)** with:\n",
      "   - Protein ADP-ribosyltransferase-substrate adaptor activity (GO:0140768)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context\n",
      "All activities occur at the site of DNA damage (GO:0090734) and participate in either DNA damage response (GO:0006974) or DNA repair (GO:0006281) processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "The model describes a well-structured sequence of molecular events:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PARP1 homodimerizes (GO:0042803)\n",
      "2. This enables PARP1's damaged DNA binding activity (GO:0003684)\n",
      "3. PARP1's DNA binding directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) its NAD+-protein-serine ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (GO:0140805)\n",
      "4. HPF1 acts as an adaptor (GO:0140768) to directly positively regulate (RO:0002629) PARP1's NAD+-protein-serine ADP-ribosyltransferase activity\n",
      "5. PARP1's serine ADP-ribosyltransferase activity enables its poly-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (GO:0003950)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Analysis and Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Scientific Accuracy**: The model accurately represents the current understanding of PARP1 activation and function during DNA repair as confirmed by the literature. PARP1 binds to damaged DNA, which activates its catalytic activity, and HPF1 functions as an adaptor to direct ADP-ribosylation specifically to serine residues.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct Representation of Mechanism**: The model correctly shows that PARP1 first homodimerizes, then binds to damaged DNA, which activates its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, assisted by HPF1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate Cellular Context**: All activities are correctly localized to the site of DNA damage (GO:0090734).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper Use of Causal Relationships**: The model properly uses the \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) relationship to connect related activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Information on HPF1 Recruitment**: The model doesn't explicitly show how HPF1 is recruited to the DNA damage site. According to the literature, PARP1 binds to DNA damage sites and recruits HPF1. This relationship could be added to make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Serine ADP-ribosylation Targets**: The model doesn't specify the targets of PARP1's serine ADP-ribosylation activity. According to the literature, key targets include histones (especially H2B and H3) and PARP1 itself (auto-modification). This information could be added to enhance the model's completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream Effects**: The model could be expanded to show the consequences of ADP-ribosylation, such as:\n",
      "   - Auto-modification of PARP1 leading to its dissociation from DNA\n",
      "   - Chromatin remodeling\n",
      "   - Recruitment of additional DNA repair factors\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Feedback Mechanism**: The literature indicates that HPF1 not only helps direct PARP1's activity to serine residues but also restricts the polymerase activity to limit chain length. This regulatory aspect could be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GO Term Usage**: The model uses appropriate GO terms for molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Relationship Logic**: The causal relationships are logically ordered and represent the known biology accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices**: The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing protein activities and their relationships. The handling of complexes follows the guidelines in the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the molecular mechanisms involved in PARP1 activation by HPF1 during DNA repair. It accurately depicts the key molecular functions of both proteins and their causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further enhance the model, I recommend:\n",
      "1. Adding the recruitment mechanism of HPF1 to PARP1 at DNA damage sites\n",
      "2. Including the specific targets of serine ADP-ribosylation\n",
      "3. Extending the model to show downstream consequences of the ADP-ribosylation activity\n",
      "4. Adding the regulatory mechanism by which HPF1 limits PARP1's polymer chain extension\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a scientifically accurate model that effectively represents current knowledge of PARP1 and HPF1 interaction during DNA repair processes.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:62900b6400000076) describes a molecular regulatory relationship between:\n",
      "1. Parp1 (MGI:MGI:1340806) which ADP-ribosylates histone H2B at glutamate 35 (Glu-35)\n",
      "2. Prkaa1 (MGI:MGI:2145955) which phosphorylates histone H2B at serine 36 (Ser-36)\n",
      "3. Nmnat1 (MGI:MGI:1913704) which acts as a protein ADP-ribosyltransferase-substrate adaptor\n",
      "\n",
      "The key relationships in the model are:\n",
      "- Nmnat1 positively regulates Parp1's ADP-ribosyltransferase activity\n",
      "- Parp1 negatively regulates Prkaa1's phosphorylation activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the literature evidence:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The relationship between ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation is accurate**: The papers (especially PMID:32822587) clearly show that ADP-ribosylation of H2B at Glu-35 by Parp1 prevents phosphorylation at Ser-36 by Prkaa1 (AMPKα1). The study demonstrates that this is a key regulatory mechanism in adipogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The role of Nmnat1 is accurately captured**: The literature (PMID:32822587) shows that Nmnat1 acts as an adaptor that directs Parp1's catalytic activity specifically to glutamate residues on histones, including H2B-Glu35. Nmnat1 is shown to function as a specificity factor that promotes Parp1's activity toward Glu/Asp residues rather than Ser residues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The molecular functions are accurately assigned**: \n",
      "   - Parp1 is annotated with \"NAD+-histone H2BE35 glutamate ADP-ribosyltransferase activity\" (GO:0140822)\n",
      "   - Prkaa1 is annotated with \"histone H2BS36 kinase activity\" (GO:0140823)\n",
      "   - Nmnat1 is annotated with \"protein ADP-ribosyltransferase-substrate adaptor activity\" (GO:0140768)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **The biological context is accurate**: The model indicates that these activities occur in chromatin (GO:0000785), which matches the experimental evidence showing that these modifications happen on chromatin-associated histones.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Modeling Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal relationships are properly represented**: \n",

      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add more context about the biological role in adipogenesis**: While the model accurately captures the molecular relationships, it could benefit from additional biological process annotations related to adipogenesis regulation, which is a key outcome discussed in PMID:32822587.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify the cellular compartment**: While \"chromatin\" is correctly annotated, adding nuclear localization might provide more complete information about where these reactions occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Redundant causal association**: There appears to be a redundant causal association from Nmnat1 to Parp1 that's listed twice with the same predicate (RO:0002629) but one instance lacks evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:62900b6400000076) accurately represents the molecular mechanism described in the literature. The ADP-ribosylation of histone H2B at Glu-35 by Parp1 (directed by Nmnat1) prevents phosphorylation at Ser-36 by Prkaa1, which has implications for transcriptional regulation. The model follows most GO-CAM best practices, appropriately representing causal relationships, molecular functions, and cellular contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model would benefit from minor improvements including adding more context about adipogenesis regulation, clarifying nuclear localization, and removing the redundant causal association, but these are relatively minor issues. The core regulatory relationship between these molecular activities is captured accurately.\n",

      "## Causal Relationships in the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts the following causal relationships:\n",
      "1. NMDA receptor complex activity (GO:0004972) directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) synaptic receptor adaptor activity (GO:0030160) of DLG4\n",
      "2. DLG4's adaptor activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) PTEN's phosphatase activity (GO:0052866)\n",
      "3. PTEN's phosphatase activity causally upstream with negative effect (RO:0002305) on β-catenin's transcription coactivator activity (GO:0003713)\n",
      "4. β-catenin's transcription activity provides input for (RO:0002407) SLC6A20's glycine transporter activity (GO:0015187)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses various evidence codes and references:\n",
      "- Most activities are supported by sequence similarity evidence (ECO:0000250) or curator inference (ECO:0000305)\n",
      "- β-catenin's transcription activity is supported by direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314)\n",
      "- Evidence is primarily based on mouse studies and extrapolated to human proteins\n",
      "- Key references include PMID:20628354, PMID:31866820, and PMID:33428810\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly represents the role of PTEN in regulating β-catenin activity and subsequently SLC6A20 expression, consistent with the literature.\n",
      "2. **Appropriate evidence**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes for the transferred annotations from mouse studies.\n",
      "3. **Proper use of ontology terms**: The activities, cellular locations, and causal relationships use appropriate GO and RO terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues/Concerns:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input/Output confusion**: SLC6A20 has both \"has_input\" and \"has_output\" relationships with glycine zwitterion (CHEBI:57305). This is contradictory as a transporter typically moves molecules in one direction. The literature suggests SLC6A20 primarily imports glycine, so having both input and output is confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing key components**: Based on the literature (PMID:33428810), there is a regulatory relationship where PTEN deletion increases β-catenin binding to the SLC6A20 promoter. The model shows PTEN negatively regulating β-catenin, but the intermediate steps (likely involving PI3K/AKT pathway) are missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Potential mismatch with human biology**: The model is annotated for human proteins, but much of the evidence comes from mouse studies. The papers indicate some differences between mouse and human SLC6A20 genes (mice have two genes, SLC6A20A and SLC6A20B, while humans have one).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Functional discrepancy in RO:0002407 usage**: The model uses \"provides input for\" (RO:0002407) between β-catenin's transcription activity and SLC6A20 transporter activity. This seems to conflate transcriptional regulation with direct molecular input. It would be more accurate to use a term that indicates transcriptional regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Missing causal connection**: The relationship between SLC6A20's glycine transport and NMDA receptor function (which requires glycine as a co-agonist) is not explicitly modeled, despite being central to the biological story in the referenced papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correct the SLC6A20 input/output inconsistency**: Remove the \"has_output\" relationship for glycine, as SLC6A20 primarily imports glycine into cells, reducing extracellular glycine concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add intermediate signaling components**: Consider adding the PI3K/AKT pathway components that mediate PTEN's regulation of β-catenin nuclear translocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complete the signaling loop**: Add a causal relationship showing how SLC6A20-mediated reduction in extracellular glycine affects NMDA receptor function to complete the biological story.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use more appropriate relationship term**: Replace RO:0002407 (provides input for) with a relationship term that better captures transcriptional regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add clarifying comments**: Add notes to explain the transfer of evidence from mouse to human and any potential species-specific differences in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model correctly captures the core components of PTEN's role in regulating hippocampal synaptic depression through β-catenin and SLC6A20, but has several issues that should be addressed to improve its accuracy and clarity. The most critical issues are the contradictory input/output relationships for SLC6A20 and the missing causal connection between SLC6A20 and NMDA receptor function. Addressing these issues would make the model a more accurate representation of the biological pathway described in the literature.\n",

      "\n",
      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: 62b4ffe300004953\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the \"Arginine ADP-riboxanation of CASP3 by C.violaceum CopC that blocks CASP3 activity, subsequent apoptosis and pyroptosis (Human).\" The model describes how the bacterial effector protein CopC from *Chromobacterium violaceum* inhibits caspase-3 (CASP3) activity through a post-translational modification called ADP-riboxanation, which in turn affects downstream cell death pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Components and Activities in the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Q7NWF2 (CopC)**: A bacterial effector protein with ADP-riboxanase activity (GO:0140740) that targets host cell caspases.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **P42574 (CASP3)**: Human caspase-3, a key effector caspase involved in apoptosis that can also trigger pyroptosis through GSDME cleavage.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **O60443 (GSDME)**: Gasdermin E, which when cleaved by caspase-3 forms pores in the cell membrane leading to pyroptotic cell death.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships in the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts several key causal relationships:\n",
      "- CopC's calmodulin binding activity (GO:0005516) triggers its ADP-riboxanase activity\n",
      "- CopC's ADP-riboxanase activity directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) caspase-3 activity\n",
      "- Caspase-3's endopeptidase activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) GSDME's wide pore channel activity\n",
      "- GSDME's wide pore channel activity is involved in pyroptotic inflammatory response (GO:0070269)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Cellular Locations\n",
      "\n",
      "- CopC is located in the host cell cytoplasm (GO:0030430)\n",
      "- Caspase-3 is in the cytosol (GO:0005829) \n",
      "- GSDME's pore-forming domain becomes membrane-associated (GO:0016020)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Validation with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by recent literature, particularly:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The 2022 papers (PMID:35338844 and PMID:35446120) which detail how CopC requires host calmodulin for activation and then specifically modifies host caspases through ADP-riboxanation at a conserved arginine residue (Arg-207 in CASP3).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The connection to pyroptosis through GSDME is consistent with Wang et al. 2017 (PMID:28459430), which showed that caspase-3 can cleave GSDME to trigger pyroptosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The described modifications and mechanisms align with the sequence information and documented PTMs in the UniProt records for these proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate biological pathway representation**: The model correctly captures the mechanism by which CopC inhibits caspase-3 through ADP-riboxanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complete causal flow**: The model represents the complete pathway from bacterial effector entry to host cell response.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Well-evidenced**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes and references recent literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Correct cellular locations**: Subcellular locations are appropriately specified for each activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional contextual processes**: The model could benefit from explicitly including the bacterial invasion/secretion context that precedes CopC delivery to the host cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expand on calmodulin binding**: The model could show more detail about how calmodulin binding activates CopC as this is a key regulatory event.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include additional caspase targets**: The literature indicates CopC can also modify other caspases (CASP7, CASP8, CASP9) beyond just CASP3. Including these additional targets could make the model more comprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Specify the modification site**: The model could explicitly note that ADP-riboxanation occurs at Arg-207 in caspase-3.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities and causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It correctly represents the causal flow of information using appropriate relationship predicates (RO:0002629 and RO:0002630).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Each activity is properly associated with a specific gene product.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Appropriate cellular components are specified for each activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The model uses evidence codes appropriately to indicate the source of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:62b4ffe300004953) accurately represents the mechanism by which *C. violaceum* CopC inhibits caspase-3 through ADP-riboxanation, thereby preventing apoptosis and pyroptosis. The model is well-supported by recent literature and follows GO-CAM best practices. With minor additions as suggested above, the model could provide an even more comprehensive representation of this bacterial immune evasion mechanism.\n",

      "# GO-CAM Model Review: Poxvirus-OPG176 inhibition of host TLR4 signaling (Human-Poxvirus)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This model ([gomodel:62b4ffe300005014](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:62b4ffe300005014)) represents the mechanism by which Vaccinia virus protein OPG176 (also known as A46R) inhibits TLR4 signaling in human host cells. The model contains four key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TLR4 (UniProtKB:O00206) - signaling receptor activity (GO:0038023)\n",
      "2. TIRAP (UniProtKB:P58753) - molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090)\n",
      "3. MYD88 (UniProtKB:Q99836) - molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090)\n",
      "4. Vaccinia virus OPG176 (UniProtKB:P26672) - protein sequestering activity (GO:0140311)\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow in the model shows:\n",
      "- TLR4 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) TIRAP activity\n",
      "- TIRAP directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) MYD88 activity\n",
      "- Vaccinia virus OPG176 directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) TIRAP activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Well-supported evidence**: Each activity and relationship in the model is supported by appropriate experimental evidence with citations to relevant publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clear biological mechanism**: The model correctly represents how Vaccinia virus protein OPG176 interferes with the TLR4 signaling pathway by inhibiting the TIRAP adaptor protein, thereby preventing downstream signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct subcellular locations**: The model correctly places TLR4 in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886) and TIRAP/MYD88 at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (GO:0031234).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper use of causal relations**: The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for the activating relationships and RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for the inhibitory relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Appropriate biological process annotations**: Each activity is properly associated with a relevant biological process - TLR4, TIRAP, and MYD88 are all part of the TLR4 signaling pathway (GO:0034142), while the viral protein is part of the symbiont-mediated suppression of host toll-like receptor signaling pathway (GO:0039722).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no significant issues with the model, but here are some minor points that could enhance its clarity and completeness:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CD14 role**: The model doesn't include CD14, which often serves as a co-receptor for LPS binding to TLR4. While not essential, adding CD14 and its interaction with LPS could provide more context for TLR4 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Downstream effects**: The model could be extended to show the downstream effects of MYD88 inhibition, such as reduced NF-κB activation and cytokine production, to provide a more complete picture of the pathway disruption consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Detailed mechanism of OPG176**: While the model correctly shows OPG176 inhibiting TIRAP, it doesn't detail the mechanism (protein sequestration). The literature indicates OPG176 directly binds to and sequesters TIRAP, preventing its interaction with TLR4. This mechanism could be more explicitly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model aligns well with the published literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **TLR4 signaling**: The basic TLR4 signaling pathway via TIRAP and MYD88 is correctly represented, consistent with the referenced papers (PMID:15618008, PMID:12055629).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **OPG176 inhibition**: The viral inhibition mechanism is correctly shown, with OPG176 targeting TIRAP (PMID:22593572). This is consistent with the role of vaccinia virus in suppressing host immune responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subcellular localization**: The model correctly places TLR4 at the plasma membrane and the adaptors at the extrinsic component of cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane, consistent with literature on TLR4 signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows the GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes and molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular functions**: Each protein is annotated with an appropriate molecular function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The model uses the correct causal relationship predicates for the depicted process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular compartments**: The model correctly specifies the cellular components where each activity occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence codes**: Appropriate evidence codes are used for each assertion in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the mechanism by which Vaccinia virus protein OPG176 inhibits TLR4 signaling in human host cells. The model is supported by appropriate evidence, follows GO-CAM best practices, and is consistent with the published literature on TLR4 signaling and viral immune evasion strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully illustrates a viral immune evasion strategy whereby a viral protein (OPG176) interferes with the host innate immune response by targeting a key adaptor molecule (TIRAP) in the TLR4 signaling pathway, preventing downstream signaling events that would normally lead to inflammatory cytokine production and antiviral responses.\n",

      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Model Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Overview:\n",
      "This model represents the interaction between a poxvirus protein (OPG022/VACWR013) and the human IL-18 signaling pathway. It shows how the viral protein inhibits IL-18 signaling as a viral immune evasion strategy. The model includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Human IL-18 (Q14116) with cytokine activity (GO:0005125)\n",
      "2. Human IL-18 receptor alpha chain (IL18R1, Q13478) with interleukin-18 receptor activity (GO:0042008)\n",
      "3. Human IL-18 receptor accessory protein (IL18RAP, O95256) with coreceptor activity (GO:0015026)\n",
      "4. Poxvirus IL-18 binding protein (P17357) with receptor decoy activity (GO:0140319)\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are part of the interleukin-18-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0035655), with the viral protein being part of a viral process aimed at suppressing host immune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Detailed Assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Structural Assessment:\n",
      "The model follows the GO-CAM best practices for representing receptor-ligand interactions according to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\":\n",
      "\n",
      "- IL-18 is properly annotated with cytokine activity (GO:0005125), which is a type of receptor ligand activity\n",
      "- IL-18 is correctly shown to occur in the extracellular space (GO:0005615), which is appropriate for a secreted cytokine\n",
      "- IL-18R1 is properly annotated with interleukin-18 receptor activity (GO:0042008), a type of signaling receptor activity\n",
      "- IL-18R1 is correctly shown to occur in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "- IL-18RAP is properly annotated with coreceptor activity (GO:0015026)\n",
      "- IL-18RAP is correctly shown to occur in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Causal Relations:\n",
      "The model uses appropriate causal relations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- IL-18 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) IL-18R1 activity\n",
      "- IL-18R1 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) IL-18RAP activity\n",
      "- The viral IL-18BP directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) IL-18 activity\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Biological Content Assessment:\n",
      "The biological content of the model is consistent with the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The model correctly represents the IL-18 signaling pathway, where IL-18 binds to IL-18R1, which then recruits IL-18RAP to form a functional receptor complex\n",
      "- The poxvirus IL-18BP acts as a decoy receptor to sequester IL-18, preventing it from binding to its cellular receptor\n",
      "- All the components are associated with the correct biological process (GO:0035655, interleukin-18-mediated signaling pathway)\n",
      "- The viral protein is correctly associated with the viral process GO:0039518 (obsolete suppression by virus of host cytokine activity)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Evidence Assessment:\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes and references:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The evidence for IL-18 cytokine activity comes from a direct assay (ECO:0000314) with reference to PMID:14528293\n",
      "- The evidence for IL-18R1 and IL-18RAP activities and their cellular locations comes from direct assays or curator inference with references to appropriate papers (PMID:25500532)\n",
      "- The evidence for the viral IL-18BP activity comes from direct assay (ECO:0000314) with reference to PMID:10769064, which directly demonstrates that poxviruses encode IL-18 binding proteins that block IL-18 activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues Found:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Obsolete Term Usage**: The model uses the term \"obsolete suppression by virus of host cytokine activity\" (GO:0039518) for the viral process. As this term is marked as obsolete, it should be updated to the current replacement term.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Automated Changes**: The model has undergone automated term replacements (noted in comments), indicating it was created before some relationship type standardizations.

      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Location Precision**: IL-18R1 and IL-18RAP are annotated to plasma membrane (GO:0005886), which is correct, but for transmembrane receptors, a more specific term like \"integral component of plasma membrane\" might be more precise if this information is available in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the inhibition of the IL-18 signaling pathway by a poxvirus IL-18 binding protein. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for signaling receptor annotation and uses appropriate evidence. The only notable issue is the use of an obsolete GO term for the viral process, which should be updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is parsimonious, focusing on the key interactions without unnecessary complexity, and it clearly communicates the biological mechanism of viral immune evasion through cytokine inhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: Update the obsolete GO term (GO:0039518), but otherwise, the model is sound and can be maintained as is.\n",

      "Poxvirus-OPG003 inhibition of host NF-kappa-B pathway via NFKB1 (Human-Poxvirus)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Basic Model Description:\n",
      "This model represents how a poxvirus protein OPG003 (G3R) inhibits the host NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by directly targeting the human NFKB1 protein. The model involves several human proteins involved in NF-kappa-B signaling (RELA, NFKB1, NFKBIA, IKBKB) and the viral protein OPG003.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Proteins in the Model:\n",
      "1. **UniProtKB:Q76QY7** - Poxvirus OPG003/G3R ankyrin repeat protein\n",
      "2. **UniProtKB:P19838** - Human NFKB1 (Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p105/p50)\n",

      "\n",
      "### Interactions and Activities:\n",
      "The model captures several key activities and interactions:\n",
      "1. IKBKB (IKK-beta) with kinase activity (GO:0008384) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "2. NFKBIA (IkappaB-alpha) with protein sequestering activity (GO:0140311) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "3. NFKB1 (p50) with DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) in chromatin\n",
      "4. RELA (p65) with DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) in chromatin\n",
      "5. Poxvirus OPG003 with protein sequestering activity (GO:0140311) in the host cell nucleus\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships:\n",
      "- IKBKB directly negatively regulates NFKBIA (RO:0002630)\n",
      "- NFKBIA directly negatively regulates both NFKB1 and RELA (RO:0002630)\n",
      "- OPG003 directly negatively regulates NFKB1 (RO:0002630)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Processes:\n",
      "- The activities of IKBKB and NFKBIA are part of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0007249)\n",
      "- NFKB1 activity is part of non-canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0038061)\n",
      "- RELA activity is part of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0007249)\n",
      "- OPG003 activity is part of symbiont-mediated suppression of host NF-kappaB cascade (GO:0085034)\n",
      "\n",
      "## QC Assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Complete Pathway Representation**: The model correctly captures the canonical NF-kappa-B pathway with the key players (IKBKB, NFKBIA, NFKB1, RELA).\n",
      "2. **Proper Cellular Locations**: The locations for each protein are appropriately assigned (cytoplasm for IKBKB and NFKBIA, chromatin for the transcription factors).\n",
      "3. **Virus-Host Interaction**: The model accurately represents how a viral protein (OPG003) disrupts host immunity by targeting NFKB1.\n",
      "4. **Evidence Support**: Activities and interactions are supported by published evidence (PMIDs).\n",
      "5. **Causal Relationships**: The regulatory relationships between components are correctly represented using RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues/Suggestions:\n",
      "1. **Duplicate Causal Association**: There appears to be a duplicate causal association between IKBKB and NFKBIA. There are two identical \"directly negatively regulates\" relationships with the same downstream activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Representation**: According to \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\", since NFKB1 and RELA form a heterodimeric complex for their function, this relationship should be explicitly modeled. The model currently treats them as independent transcription factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pathway Connectivity**: The model doesn't explicitly show that IKBKB's regulation of NFKBIA ultimately leads to activation of NFKB1/RELA. A clearer connection in the pathway flow would improve the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular Clarity**: It would be helpful to clarify that IKBKB phosphorylates NFKBIA, leading to its degradation and subsequent release of NFKB1/RELA. The specific mechanisms could be more explicitly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence Completeness**: One of the causal associations from IKBKB to NFKBIA has no evidence cited, which should be addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Consistency:\n",
      "The model is largely consistent with our understanding of NF-kappa-B signaling and viral interference:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In the canonical NF-kappa-B pathway, IKBKB phosphorylates NFKBIA, which leads to NFKBIA degradation and release of NFKB1-RELA heterodimers to translocate to the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The poxvirus protein OPG003 is correctly shown to interfere with this pathway by sequestering NFKB1, which is consistent with how many viruses disrupt host immunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The roles of NFKB1 and RELA as DNA-binding transcription factors are properly represented, though their relationship as a heterodimeric complex could be made more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove Duplicate Association**: The duplicate causal association between IKBKB and NFKBIA should be eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Represent the NFKB1-RELA Complex**: Consider explicitly modeling the heterodimeric relationship between NFKB1 and RELA in the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complete Evidence**: Add supporting evidence for the causal association that currently lacks it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarify Regulatory Mechanisms**: Consider adding annotations to clarify the specific mechanisms (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, etc.) that occur during these regulatory events.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Improve Pathway Connectivity**: Make the flow from IKBKB through NFKBIA to NFKB1/RELA more explicit, perhaps by using different relationship types or adding intermediate steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively captures the essence of how a poxvirus protein disrupts host NF-kappa-B signaling, with a few opportunities for improvements in the representation of complexes and pathway connectivity.\n",

      "\n",
      "This model represents the inhibitory mechanism by which poxvirus protein A49 (OPG179) interferes with the host NF-kappa-B signaling pathway. The model shows how the poxvirus protein prevents NF-kappa-B activation by targeting the host E3 ubiquitin ligase beta-TrCP (BTRC).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents the key molecular interactions based on the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Protein Sequestering Activity by A49 (UniProtKB:P31037)**: \n",
      "   - The poxvirus protein A49 (labeled as VACWR175) correctly uses \"protein sequestering activity\" (GO:0140311) to inhibit BTRC.\n",
      "   - The paper evidence (PMID:30819886) supports that A49 binds to beta-TrCP (BTRC) to prevent its normal function.\n",
      "   - A49 is correctly localized to \"host cell cytoplasm\" (GO:0030430) as supported by the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **BTRC (UniProtKB:Q9Y297) Function**: \n",
      "   - BTRC is correctly annotated with \"ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity\" (GO:1990756).\n",
      "   - This activity is supported by the evidence citation PMID:10066435.\n",
      "   - The cytoplasmic localization of BTRC is accurately represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **NFKBIA (UniProtKB:P25963) Function**: \n",
      "   - The model correctly represents NFKBIA's \"protein sequestering activity\" (GO:0140311).\n",
      "   - The evidence citation PMID:1493333 supports that NFKBIA binds to and sequesters NF-kappa-B subunits in the cytoplasm.\n",
      "   - The cytoplasmic localization of NFKBIA is correctly represented based on the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **RELA (UniProtKB:Q04206) Function**: \n",
      "   - RELA is correctly annotated with \"DNA-binding transcription factor activity\" (GO:0003700).\n",
      "   - Its localization in \"chromatin\" (GO:0000785) is accurate as it binds to DNA when active.\n",

      "   - The causal relationship between A49 and BTRC (A49 directly negatively regulates BTRC) is supported by PMID:30819886.\n",
      "   - The causal relationship between BTRC and NFKBIA (BTRC directly negatively regulates NFKBIA) is supported by PMID:10066435.\n",
      "   - The causal relationship between NFKBIA and RELA (NFKBIA directly negatively regulates RELA) is supported by PMID:1493333.\n",

      "## Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: \n",
      "   - Based on the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, the model correctly represents the activities of individual proteins when their specific functions are known.\n",
      "   - The model doesn't use complex IDs because the molecular activities of each component (A49, BTRC, NFKBIA, RELA) are known and distinctly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Part_of Relations**:\n",
      "   - All activities are appropriately linked to the biological process \"non-canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction\" (GO:0038061) or \"symbiont-mediated suppression of host NF-kappaB cascade\" (GO:0085034).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Associations**:\n",
      "   - The model uses the correct relationship \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630) to represent inhibitory relationships.\n",
      "   - The chain of causality is logically consistent: A49 inhibits BTRC, which would normally degrade NFKBIA, thus NFKBIA can continue to sequester RELA.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence**:\n",
      "   - Each activity and causal relationship is supported by appropriate evidence citations using PMIDs.\n",
      "   - The evidence types (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) are appropriate for the experimental evidence provided in the papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathways and Activity Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents the molecular mechanism described in the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. During viral infection, poxvirus A49 protein uses protein sequestering activity to bind to host BTRC.\n",
      "2. By binding BTRC, A49 prevents BTRC from ubiquitinating NFKBIA, which would normally lead to NFKBIA degradation.\n",
      "3. Because NFKBIA is not degraded, it continues to sequester RELA in the cytoplasm.\n",
      "4. This prevents RELA from translocating to the nucleus and activating NF-kappa-B-dependent gene expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "This chain of causality is consistent with the viral strategy to suppress host immune responses by inhibiting NF-kappa-B activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-constructed and biologically accurate, but a few minor improvements could be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional Context**: \n",
      "   - Consider adding information about the phosphorylation status of A49, as described in PMID:30819886, which indicates A49 is phosphorylated on serine 7 to enable binding to beta-TrCP.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Temporal Aspects**: \n",
      "   - The model could potentially include information about the temporal regulation of this process, as the literature suggests A49's ability to bind BTRC is regulated by phosphorylation events that occur during NF-kappa-B pathway activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expand to Include Additional Known Interactions**:\n",
      "   - If appropriate for the scope of the model, consider including other beta-TrCP substrates that might be affected by A49 binding, as mentioned in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:62b4ffe300005342 is accurate, well-evidenced, and follows GO-CAM best practices. It correctly represents the mechanism by which poxvirus protein A49 inhibits NF-kappa-B activation by interfering with the BTRC-mediated degradation of NFKBIA.

      "## Overview of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes the interaction between a poxvirus protein (KBTB1/OPG184) and the host NF-kappaB signaling pathway, specifically showing how the viral protein inhibits NF-kappaB nuclear translocation by targeting the nuclear import machinery via KPNA2 (importin alpha-2).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Components in the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four main activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Nuclear import signal receptor activity** (GO:0061608) of KPNA2 (UniProtKB:P52292) occurring in nuclear membrane (GO:0031965), part of protein import into nucleus (GO:0006606)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **DNA-binding transcription factor activity** (GO:0003700) of RELA/p65 (UniProtKB:Q04206) occurring in chromatin (GO:0000785), part of non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling (GO:0038061)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Protein sequestering activity** (GO:0140311) of NFKBIA/IkappaBalpha (UniProtKB:P25963) occurring in cytoplasm (GO:0005737), part of non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling (GO:0038061)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity** (GO:1990756) of KBTB1/OPG184 (UniProtKB:P24768) occurring in host cell cytoplasm (GO:0030430), part of symbiont-mediated suppression of host NF-kappaB cascade (GO:0085034)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains two causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. NFKBIA directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) KPNA2 nuclear import signal receptor activity\n",
      "2. KPNA2 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) RELA DNA-binding transcription factor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the viral protein KBTB1/OPG184's ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) KPNA2 nuclear import signal receptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular mechanisms**: The model correctly represents the role of KPNA2 in nuclear import of RELA/p65 and how the viral protein interferes with this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The causal relationships between components correctly represent how the process works in the cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct cellular locations**: Each activity is assigned appropriate cellular locations where the processes occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence-based model**: The model is supported by published literature, with appropriate evidence codes and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing connection from NFKBIA to RELA**: While the model shows NFKBIA inhibiting KPNA2, the direct regulatory relationship between NFKBIA and RELA is not represented. According to the PMID:1493333 paper, NFKBIA directly binds to RELA and prevents its nuclear translocation. This direct relationship should be included in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete representation of protein complex interactions**: According to the GO-CAM complex annotation guidelines, if the specific activity is carried by a known subunit (as in this case where KPNA2 specifically binds to RELA), that should be explicitly represented. The model does correctly show this, but could be improved by clarifying that KPNA2 and importin-beta form a complex during nuclear import.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incomplete representation of the NF-kappaB pathway**: The model focuses on non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling, but doesn't fully represent how this pathway is activated or additional components that might be involved in the signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Canonical pathway annotation**: Based on the literature provided (particularly PMID:30814284), this appears to be related to canonical NF-kappaB signaling rather than non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling. This should be reviewed and potentially corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Mechanistic details on viral protein function**: While the model correctly shows that KBTB1/OPG184 inhibits KPNA2, it could better represent the mechanistic details of how this occurs. Based on PMID:30814284, the viral protein appears to act by disrupting the p65-importin interaction, which could be more explicitly modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add direct relationship from NFKBIA to RELA**: Add a causal relationship showing that NFKBIA directly negatively regulates RELA's DNA-binding transcription factor activity.\n",

      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well supported by evidence from the literature, with most activities and causal relationships supported by direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) and appropriate citations to PMID:17878161, which appears to be the primary source for this model. Some of the cellular location information is supported by curator inference (ECO:0000305).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Critique and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the mechanism by which poxvirus A52 inhibits the NF-κB pathway.\n",
      "2. The causal relationships between components are appropriate and follow the known signaling cascade.\n",
      "3. Each activity has proper evidence annotations with appropriate ECO codes.\n",
      "4. The biological context (host-pathogen interaction) is clearly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation:** According to the guidelines in \"How_to_annotate_complexes_in_GO-CAM,\" if the TRAF6-mediated signaling involves a complex, this could be better represented. The current model shows individual proteins rather than complexes, which may be appropriate if the precise activity-bearing subunits are known, but it would be helpful to clarify this.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Process Annotation Consistency:** There's a mix of canonical (GO:0007249) and non-canonical (GO:0038061) NF-κB signaling processes in the model. It would be helpful to clarify if this is intentional or if there should be consistency in which pathway is being represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Depth:** While evidence codes and PMIDs are appropriate, it would be beneficial to have more specific evidence for some of the assertions, especially since the full text of PMID:17878161 wasn't available for review.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connection to Downstream Effects:** The model could potentially be expanded to show the ultimate effects on gene expression or other cellular responses following NF-κB inhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Further Clarification of A52 Mechanism:** If available in the literature, additional details on how A52 specifically sequesters IRAK2 (e.g., binding mechanism, competition with other proteins) could enhance the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Review:\n",
      "\n",
      "All the required relationships and annotations are present in the model. The model follows GO-CAM best practices with appropriate annotations for molecular function, cellular component, and biological process for each activity. The causal relationships use the correct predicates (RO:0002629 for positive regulation and RO:0002630 for negative regulation).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider adding additional evidence if available, particularly for the sequestering mechanism.\n",
      "2. Clarify the distinction between canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling in this context.\n",
      "3. Consider expanding the model to include downstream effects on transcription factors or gene expression.\n",
      "4. Ensure consistency in the representation of any protein complexes involved in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents how the vaccinia virus protein A52 inhibits NF-κB signaling by targeting IRAK2, which disrupts downstream signaling through TRAF6, MAP3K7, and CHUK. With minor clarifications and potential expansions as suggested, this model provides valuable insights into host-pathogen interactions in the context of immune signaling.\n",

      "3. LAT directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) TRAF6's ubiquitin protein ligase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. **Biological Accuracy:** The model correctly represents the mechanism described in PMID:25907557, where HHV-1 US3 protein inhibits T cell signaling by interfering with LAT activation via TRAF6.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Use of GO Terms:** The molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes are appropriately assigned to each protein based on their known roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate Causal Relationships:** The causal relationships use the correct relation ontology terms (RO:0002629 for positive regulation, RO:0002630 for negative regulation).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence Support:** All assertions in the model are supported by specific literature references with appropriate evidence codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues Found\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Target Input for Sequestering Activity:** According to the \"Protein sequestering activity\" guidelines, the protein that acts as a sequesterer should have a \"has input\" relation to its target. In this model, there is no explicit \"has input\" relationship between US3 and LAT.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete Representation of TRAF6-LAT Mechanism:** Based on PMID:25907557 and UniProt entries, US3 prevents LAT and TRAF6 interaction, but the model doesn't fully show this mechanistic detail. The paper suggests US3 confines LAT activation via TRAF6, indicating US3 may prevent TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of LAT.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **ZAP70-LAT Relationship Evidence Needs Clarification:** The model correctly shows ZAP70 positively regulating LAT, but the evidence cited (PMID:15292186) appears to focus on ZAP70 kinase structure rather than specifically on LAT phosphorylation. While ZAP70 is known to phosphorylate LAT (as confirmed in PMID:9489702), the evidence citation could be more specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lack of Molecular Details:** The model doesn't capture some mechanistic details, such as the phosphorylation of LAT by ZAP70 or the ubiquitination of LAT by TRAF6.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add \"has input\" Relation:** Add a \"has input\" relation from US3's protein sequestering activity to LAT to properly represent the sequestering mechanism as per GO-CAM guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify Mechanism:** Consider clarifying that US3 prevents the interaction between TRAF6 and LAT, disrupting LAT ubiquitination by TRAF6. This could be done by adding additional details or comments to the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Review Evidence Citations:** Review the evidence citation for the ZAP70-LAT relationship and consider citing PMID:9489702 as the primary evidence for this relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Adding Molecular Details:** If appropriate based on available evidence, consider adding more molecular details such as:\n",
      "   - Phosphorylation of LAT by ZAP70 at specific sites\n",
      "   - Ubiquitination of LAT by TRAF6 (with Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add Contextual Information:** Consider adding a comment or description to the model that explains the viral evasion strategy, highlighting how this disruption of TCR signaling benefits the virus by suppressing host immune responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The model \"HHV1-US3 inhibition of host TCR signaling via LAT\" provides a clear representation of how HHV-1 US3 protein inhibits T cell receptor signaling by interfering with LAT function. The model correctly uses GO and relation ontology terms and is supported by appropriate evidence. With a few minor improvements as suggested above, the model would provide an even more complete and accurate representation of this host-pathogen interaction mechanism.\n",

      "The model follows several GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper molecular functions**: Each protein is annotated with the correct molecular function:\n",

      "\n",
      "While this is a well-constructed model, I would suggest the following improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional Detail**: The model could be enhanced by directly capturing US3's phosphorylation of RIG-I at serine-8 (S8), which is a key molecular event detailed in PMID:34935440. This would provide a more precise mechanistic representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expanded Context**: The model could benefit from including downstream effects, such as the inhibition of IRF3 activation and type I interferon production, which would provide a more complete picture of the biological significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Potential Update to Relationships**: The model currently shows US3 directly negatively regulating TRIM25, but PMID:34935440 indicates that US3 directly targets RIG-I by phosphorylating it at S8, which then prevents TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination. The model could more accurately represent this by showing US3 directly negatively regulating RIG-I, which then affects TRIM25's ability to ubiquitinate RIG-I.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Basic Description\n",
      "This model represents the mechanism by which Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) protein kinase US3 inhibits NF-κB activation by hyperphosphorylating p65/RelA (RELA), a key component of the NF-κB transcription factor complex. The model demonstrates a viral evasion strategy that suppresses host immune responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four activities connected in a causal chain:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **US3 protein kinase activity** (UniProtKB:P04413, GO:0004674) - Occurs in host cell cytoplasm (GO:0030430)\n",
      "2. **Nuclear import signal receptor activity** (UniProtKB:P52292, GO:0061608) - Occurs in nuclear membrane (GO:0031965)\n",
      "3. **DNA-binding transcription factor activity** (UniProtKB:Q04206, GO:0003700) - Occurs in chromatin (GO:0000785)\n",
      "4. **Protein sequestering activity** (UniProtKB:P25963, GO:0140311) - Occurs in cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships are:\n",
      "- US3 kinase (P04413) directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) KPNA2 nuclear import signal receptor activity (P52292)\n",
      "- KPNA2 (P52292) directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) RELA transcription factor activity (Q04206)\n",
      "- NFKBIA/IκBα (P25963) directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) KPNA2 activity (P52292)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is scientifically accurate based on the literature. The PMID:24807716 paper clearly demonstrates that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. HSV-1 US3 inhibits NF-κB activation by hyperphosphorylating p65/RELA at serine 75\n",
      "2. This hyperphosphorylation blocks nuclear translocation of p65/RELA\n",
      "3. US3 kinase activity is essential for this inhibition, as kinase-dead mutants fail to block NF-κB activation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents US3's role in directly negatively regulating KPNA2, which is responsible for nuclear import of RELA. This prevents p65/RELA from entering the nucleus and activating NF-κB target genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately captures the key mechanism of HSV-1 immune evasion through US3-mediated suppression of NF-κB\n",
      "2. Proper use of causal relationships (directly positively/negatively regulates)\n",
      "3. Appropriate cellular locations are specified for each activity\n",
      "4. Clear biological process annotations for each activity\n",
      "5. Evidence is properly documented with PMIDs and ECO codes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing molecular details**: The model doesn't explicitly represent the hyperphosphorylation of RELA at serine 75, which is the key mechanistic detail from the PMID:24807716 paper. This could be added as additional information.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete representation of NFKBIA's role**: While NFKBIA's protein sequestering activity is included, the model doesn't fully capture its normal role in sequestering RELA in the cytoplasm until activation signals trigger NFKBIA degradation. The model could better explain how US3 exploitation of the pathway relates to normal pathway regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Contextual information**: The model could benefit from additional context about when in the viral life cycle this activity occurs, or how it relates to other HSV-1 immune evasion strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process connection**: The part_of relationship for US3 kinase activity points to \"negative regulation of protein localization to nucleus\" (GO:1900181), which is correct, but could be more specific to immune regulation or viral host modulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM guidelines:\n",
      "- Appropriate use of causal relationships\n",
      "- Proper specification of cellular locations\n",
      "- Correct representation of protein activities\n",
      "\n",
      "The automated changes noted in the model comments (\"RO:0002212 replaced by RO:0002630\", \"RO:0002213 replaced by RO:0002629\", and \"GO:0039644 replaced by GO:0085034\") reflect ontology term updates and do not affect the biological accuracy of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model effectively represents the mechanism by which HSV-1 US3 kinase inhibits NF-κB activation by preventing nuclear translocation of RELA through hyperphosphorylation. The model is scientifically accurate and properly structured, though it could be enhanced with more molecular details about the specific phosphorylation event and a more complete representation of the normal regulation of the NF-κB pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a valuable model that captures an important viral immune evasion strategy. With minor enhancements, it could provide even more complete information about this host-pathogen interaction mechanism.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model describes how Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) US3 protein kinase inhibits the host interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to suppress the host antiviral immune response. Specifically, it shows a mechanism where the US3 viral protein kinase hyperphosphorylates IRF3 to prevent its nuclear translocation, thereby inhibiting type I interferon production.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four main activities:\n",
      "1. US3 protein kinase activity (HSV-1 protein)\n",
      "2. IPO5 nuclear import signal receptor activity (host protein)\n",
      "3. TBK1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity (host protein)\n",
      "4. IRF3 DNA-binding transcription factor activity (host protein)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological content of the model is consistent with recent literature. The model accurately represents:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The US3 protein of HSV-1 as a serine/threonine kinase that can hyperphosphorylate IRF3 at Ser175 to prevent its activation\n",
      "2. The nuclear import process of IRF3 via IPO5\n",
      "3. The role of TBK1 in phosphorylating IRF3 at canonical sites like Ser386 to promote its activation\n",
      "4. The function of IRF3 as a transcription factor that binds to DNA in host chromatin to promote cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly shows how the viral kinase US3 negatively regulates the host innate immune response by directly phosphorylating IRF3, which prevents its nuclear translocation and subsequent transcriptional activation of interferon genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Structure Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The structure of the model follows GO-CAM best practices regarding causal relationships and activity representations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Correct use of molecular function terms for each gene product\n",
      "2. Appropriate cellular location annotations for each activity\n",
      "3. Proper placement of activities within biological process contexts\n",
      "4. Appropriate use of causal relationships:\n",
      "   - US3 negatively regulates IPO5 via RO:0012010\n",
      "   - IPO5 positively regulates IRF3 via RO:0002629\n",
      "   - TBK1 regulates IRF3 via RO:0002413 (provides input for)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Detailed Analysis of Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **US3 to IPO5 interaction (RO:0012010)**: \n",
      "   - The model correctly represents that US3 kinase directly targets and negatively regulates IPO5's nuclear import signal receptor activity. This relationship is supported by evidence from PMID:24049179, which demonstrates that US3 hyperphosphorylates IRF3 to inhibit its nuclear import.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **TBK1 to IPO5 interaction (RO:0002413)**:\n",
      "   - The model shows TBK1 providing input for IPO5, which accurately reflects how TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3 is a prerequisite for its nuclear import via IPO5. This is supported by evidence from PMID:29441066.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **IPO5 to IRF3 interaction (RO:0002629)**:\n",
      "   - IPO5 is shown to directly positively regulate IRF3 transcription factor activity, which correctly represents its role in transporting phosphorylated IRF3 into the nucleus. This is supported by evidence from PMID:31340999.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes and references:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) for most functional annotations\n",
      "- ECO:0000305 (curator inference used in manual assertion) for some annotations\n",
      "- All evidence is backed by relevant primary research papers (PMID:8524823, PMID:24049179, PMID:24807716, PMID:29441066)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Mechanistic Detail**: \n",
      "   - The model doesn't fully capture the mechanistic details of how US3 disrupts the IRF3-IPO5 interaction. According to PMID:31340999, US3 hyperphosphorylates IRF3 at Ser175, which is different from the canonical TBK1 phosphorylation sites. This differential phosphorylation disrupts the interaction between IRF3 and IPO5, preventing nuclear import. The model could be enhanced by explicitly representing this phosphorylation event.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete Representation of Signaling Pathway**: \n",
      "   - The model focuses specifically on the IRF3-IPO5 nuclear import process but doesn't include the upstream components of the antiviral signaling pathway (such as pathogen recognition receptors, MAVS, etc.) or the downstream components (IFN-β gene expression). Including these would provide a more comprehensive view of how US3 interrupts the host antiviral response.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Complex Relationships**: \n",
      "   - The model doesn't represent potential complexes that might be involved in this process, such as the TBK1-IRF3 complex that forms before IRF3 phosphorylation, or the IRF3-CBP/p300 complex that forms in the nucleus to activate transcription.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lack of Information on Other Viral Evasion Strategies**: \n",
      "   - While focusing on US3's role is appropriate, the model could benefit from contextualizing this within HSV-1's broader immune evasion strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (62b4ffe300006001) accurately represents the current scientific understanding of how HSV-1 US3 kinase inhibits the host antiviral response by targeting IRF3. The model uses appropriate GO terms, relationship types, and evidence codes, and is consistent with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations for improvement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add specific annotation for the US3-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser175, differentiating it from the canonical TBK1-mediated phosphorylation sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider expanding the model to include more of the antiviral signaling pathway, particularly the downstream effects on IFN-β gene expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Explore the possibility of representing the TBK1-IRF3 and IRF3-CBP/p300 complexes that play critical roles in IRF3 activation and function.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Add notes or references to other HSV-1 immune evasion strategies to contextualize US3's role.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Consider adding temporal information about when these interactions occur during the viral life cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these suggestions for enhancement, the model in its current form is scientifically accurate, well-structured according to GO-CAM best practices, and represents a valuable contribution to our understanding of host-pathogen interactions in HSV-1 infection.\n",

      "**Status:** Production\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Description\n",
      "This model describes how the Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HHV-1) UL37 protein targets and inhibits the host RNA sensor protein RIG-I (encoded by UniProtKB:O95786) through deamidation, preventing RIG-I from recognizing viral RNA and thereby suppressing antiviral responses. The model shows the molecular activities, interactions and regulatory relationships between viral UL37, host RIG-I, TRIM25, and MAVS proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Activities represented:\n",
      "1. RIG-I (UniProtKB:O95786) acts as a pattern recognition receptor\n",
      "2. TRIM25 (UniProtKB:Q14258) functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase\n",

      "- TRIM25 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity positively regulates MAVS signaling adaptor activity\n",
      "- HHV-1 UL37 deamidase activity negatively regulates RIG-I pattern recognition receptor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Biological Accuracy:\n",
      "The model accurately represents the scientific understanding of how HHV-1 UL37 inhibits the RIG-I signaling pathway. Based on the literature reviewed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **RIG-I function and pathway**: The model correctly shows RIG-I (O95786) as a pattern recognition receptor that occurs in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737) and is part of the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway (GO:0002753). This is supported by the literature (PMID:19576794).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **RIG-I regulation by TRIM25**: The model correctly shows that RIG-I positively regulates TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is essential for RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses. The literature (PMID:17392790) confirms that TRIM25 interacts with RIG-I and is required for RIG-I activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **MAVS role**: The model correctly represents MAVS (Q7Z434) as a signaling adaptor that is positively regulated by TRIM25 and is part of the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway. This is supported by PMID:16125763.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **HHV-1 UL37 inhibition of RIG-I**: The critical viral evasion mechanism is accurately represented, showing that UL37 protein (P10221) has protein-glutamine glutaminase activity (GO:0050568) that occurs in the host cytoplasm (GO:0030430). The literature (PMID:27866900) confirms that UL37 acts as a deamidase that targets RIG-I to block RNA-induced activation by deamidating specific asparagine residues in the RIG-I helicase domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### GO-CAM Structure and Completeness:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The model correctly uses the following relationship predicates:\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for RIG-I's effect on TRIM25\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for TRIM25's effect on MAVS\n",
      "   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for UL37's effect on RIG-I\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate cellular locations**: All proteins are annotated with their correct cellular locations:\n",
      "   - RIG-I in cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - TRIM25 in cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - MAVS in mitochondrial membrane (GO:0031966)\n",
      "   - UL37 in host cell cytoplasm (GO:0030430)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate molecular functions**: The activities are properly represented:\n",
      "   - RIG-I: pattern recognition receptor activity (GO:0038187)\n",
      "   - TRIM25: ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "   - MAVS: signaling adaptor activity (GO:0035591)\n",
      "   - UL37: protein-glutamine glutaminase activity (GO:0050568)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate biological processes**: All activities are linked to the correct biological processes:\n",
      "   - RIG-I, TRIM25, and MAVS are part of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway (GO:0002753)\n",
      "   - UL37 is part of symbiont-mediated suppression of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway (GO:0039537)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Conformance to GO-CAM Standards:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence codes**: All associations are supported with appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 direct assay evidence) and reference to primary literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex representation**: The model appropriately represents the activities of individual proteins rather than representing them as a complex, which is in line with the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document guidelines, since the specific activities of the individual proteins are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is scientifically accurate and well-structured, there are a few potential enhancements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional molecular detail**: The model could be expanded to include the specific mechanism of UL37-mediated deamidation of RIG-I. According to PMID:27866900, UL37 specifically deamidates asparagine residues N495 and N549 in the helicase domain of RIG-I. This specific targeting prevents RIG-I from recognizing viral dsRNA.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Downstream consequences**: The model could include the downstream effects of inhibiting RIG-I signaling, such as reduced type I interferon production, which is a key outcome of this viral evasion mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Protein domains**: Adding information about the specific domains involved in the interactions (e.g., RIG-I CARD domain interaction with TRIM25 SPRY domain) could provide additional molecular detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:62b4ffe300006376 is a high-quality representation of the HHV-1 UL37-mediated inhibition of RIG-I signaling. It accurately captures the scientific knowledge about this viral evasion mechanism, uses appropriate GO terms and relationship predicates, and follows GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents how HHV-1 UL37 acts as a viral deamidase that negatively regulates RIG-I pattern recognition receptor activity, thereby disrupting the host's ability to detect viral RNA and mount an antiviral response. The regulatory relationships between RIG-I, TRIM25, and MAVS are also accurately captured, providing a complete picture of this pathway and how it is targeted by the virus.\n",
      "\n",

      "This model represents the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway in mouse, focusing on the molecular interactions involving Shc1, Grb2, Sos1/2, and Syk proteins. The model describes a key signaling cascade that connects BCR activation to the Ras pathway. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains 7 activities:\n",
      "1. Sos1 - guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity (GO:0005085)\n",
      "2. Grb2 - guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor adaptor activity (GO:0005091) \n",
      "3. PR:P98083-2 (Shc1/p52Shc) - protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674)\n",
      "4. Syk - protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713)\n",
      "5. Cd79a - transmembrane signaling receptor activity (GO:0004888)\n",
      "6. Cd79b - transmembrane signaling receptor activity (GO:0004888)\n",
      "7. Sos2 - guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity (GO:0005085)\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are part of the B cell receptor signaling pathway (GO:0050853), which is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "The model includes these causal relationships:\n",
      "- Syk → Shc1 (RO:0002629, directly positively regulates)\n",
      "- Shc1 → Grb2 (RO:0002629, directly positively regulates)\n",
      "- Grb2 → Sos1 (RO:0002629, directly positively regulates)\n",
      "- Grb2 → Sos2 (RO:0002629, directly positively regulates)\n",
      "\n",
      "These relationships accurately depict the directional flow of signaling in the BCR pathway based on the literature, where Syk phosphorylates Shc1, which recruits Grb2, which in turn recruits Sos1/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes good evidence support:\n",
      "- Syk's role is supported by experimental evidence (ECO:0000314, direct assay evidence) from PMID:9199344\n",
      "- Shc1's role is supported by the same direct assay evidence\n",
      "- Grb2's role is also supported by direct assay evidence from PMID:9199344\n",
      "- Sos1's role is supported by sequence orthology evidence (ECO:0000266) from PMID:11333268 and mutant phenotype evidence (ECO:0000315) from PMID:29844066\n",
      "- Sos2's role lacks specific evidence annotation\n",
      "- The CD79a/b roles are supported by direct assay evidence from PMID:8626447\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular pathway representation**: The model correctly captures the key steps in the B cell receptor signaling pathway, showing how signals from the BCR are transmitted to activate the Ras pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate evidence**: Most activities are backed by experimental evidence from relevant publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct protein roles**: The model accurately represents the roles of each protein, particularly the adaptor functions of Shc1 and Grb2, and the catalytic activity of Sos1/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use of protein isoforms**: The model specifically uses the p52Shc isoform of Shc1 (PR:P98083-2), which is known to be important in this signaling context according to PMID:9199344.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sos2 evidence**: The Sos2 activity lacks specific evidence annotation. Based on the PMID:29844066 paper, there's evidence for functional redundancy between Sos1 and Sos2, which should be added as evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing CD79a/b connection**: While CD79a and CD79b are included in the model, they lack causal connections to Syk. Based on literature, CD79a/b are phosphorylated after BCR cross-linking, creating docking sites for Syk. This causal relationship should be added.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing BCR complex**: The model doesn't explicitly show how the BCR itself connects to CD79a/b. Including a representation of the BCR complex would make the initiation of signaling clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex representation**: According to the GO-CAM complex annotation guidelines, when the subunit carrying the molecular activity is known (as in this case), each protein should be represented separately with their specific activity. This is done correctly here. However, it might be useful to note that Shc1-Grb2-Sos forms a multiprotein complex, perhaps as a comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ras activation**: The model doesn't show the ultimate target of Sos1/2, which is Ras activation. Adding this downstream event would complete the signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the known biology of BCR signaling:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. As shown in PMID:9199344, BCR stimulation leads to Syk-dependent phosphorylation of Shc1, creating binding sites for Grb2, which then recruits Sos1/2 to activate Ras.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The model correctly represents the role of p52Shc (PR:P98083-2) which contains the two phosphorylation sites (Y239 and Y313) that serve as binding sites for Grb2 according to the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The inclusion of both Sos1 and Sos2 reflects their functional redundancy in mouse, as demonstrated in the PMID:29844066 paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:62b4ffe300006474) accurately represents a critical signaling pathway in B cell receptor activation. It correctly depicts the roles of key proteins and their causal relationships, with appropriate evidence support. The model could be enhanced by adding the missing causal connections for CD79a/b to Syk and by showing the downstream activation of Ras. Overall, the model is biologically sound and follows GO-CAM annotation best practices.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model captures all major enzymatic steps of gluconeogenesis, including both mitochondrial and cytosolic phases of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper causal connections**: The activities are correctly connected via \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) relationships that accurately follow the substrate flow through the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate subcellular localization**: Activities are correctly localized to relevant cellular compartments (cytosol, ER, mitochondria), which is essential for representing gluconeogenesis properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence quality**: Each activity is supported by specific evidence in the form of PMIDs, with appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay, ECO:0000315 - mutant phenotype, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Taxonomic specificity**: The model appropriately represents the mouse (MGI) proteins, providing a species-specific representation of gluconeogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incomplete causal chain**: There is a missing causal link between phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck2, gomodel:62d0afa500000132/62d0afa500000206) and enolase (Eno1, gomodel:62d0afa500000132/62d0afa500000148). This breaks the continuity of the pathway flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Branching missing for G6pc3**: While both G6pc1 and G6pc3 (glucose-6-phosphatase isoforms) are represented in the model, G6pc3 (gomodel:62d0afa500000132/62f58d8800003972) lacks outgoing causal connections, making its role in the pathway unclear. It should either connect to the next step or be noted as an endpoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulatory elements**: The model focuses on the catalytic flow of gluconeogenesis but does not include regulatory elements that control the pathway. Including key regulatory interactions (e.g., glucagon or insulin signaling) would enhance the biological completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Substrate visualization**: While the causal flow is represented correctly, the model doesn't explicitly show the substrate transformations. Adding annotations about the metabolites being processed at each step would improve clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Tissue context**: Gluconeogenesis predominantly occurs in the liver and kidney in mammals. Adding tissue context information would enhance the biological relevance of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scientific Validity\n",
      "\n",
      "The literature evidence provided in the model supports the represented activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The UniProt entry for G6pc1 (P35576) confirms its role in glucose-6-phosphate hydrolysis in the ER, consistent with its representation in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The reference PMID:24958256 confirms the importance of gluconeogenesis in metabolic regulation and mentions several of the enzymes included in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The subcellular localizations are consistent with known biology - mitochondrial enzymes (Pcx, Pck2) are correctly placed in the mitochondrial matrix, while cytosolic enzymes are in the cytosol.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pathway Logic and Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall flow of gluconeogenesis is correctly represented:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mitochondrial initiation**: Starting with pyruvate carboxylase (Pcx) converting pyruvate to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mitochondrial to cytosolic transition**: Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck2) converting oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cytosolic reversed glycolysis**: The cytosolic enzymes (Eno1 → Pgam1 → Pgk1 → Gapdh → Tpi1 → Aldoc) performing essentially glycolysis in reverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Final glucose production steps**: The final steps (Fbp1 → Gpi1 → G6pc1/G6pc3 and Slc37a4) correctly represent the production and transport of glucose.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add missing causal link**: Connect Pck2 to Eno1 to complete the pathway flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify G6pc3 role**: Either connect G6pc3 to downstream processes or annotate it as an endpoint with notes on its specific role.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include regulation**: Add key regulatory interactions, such as how insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis or how glucagon activates it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add tissue context**: Specify the tissue context (liver/kidney) where this pathway predominantly functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider adding complexes**: Some enzymes may function as complexes; using GO guidelines for complex representation would enhance model accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Substrate annotation**: Consider adding annotations about the intermediates being processed at each enzymatic step for increased clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the gluconeogenesis pathway in mouse, with appropriate gene products, subcellular localizations, and mostly correct causal flow. The model strongly adheres to GO-CAM best practices but would benefit from addressing the gaps in causal connections and adding regulatory elements.

      "1. PCX → GOT2 → (transporters SLC25A13/SLC25A12/SLC25A11) → GOT1\n",
      "2. GOT1 → PCK1 → ENO1 → PGAM1 → PGK1 → GAPDH → TPI1/ALDOC → FBP1 → GPI1 → SLC37A4 → G6PC1/G6PC3\n",
      "\n",
      "This correctly represents the conversion of pyruvate to glucose through the gluconeogenesis pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Assessment\n",
      "The model has appropriate evidence for most assertions:\n",
      "- Most activities have evidence codes ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) or ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence)\n",
      "- All assertions include PMID references\n",
      "- Appropriate use of with/from fields for some evidence types\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. Comprehensive representation of the gluconeogenesis pathway\n",
      "2. Correct subcellular localization of enzymes\n",
      "3. Good use of evidence codes and references\n",
      "4. Proper causal connections showing the flow of the pathway\n",
      "5. Inclusion of relevant transporters necessary for shuttle mechanisms\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues/Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Evidence**: Some subcellular locations are missing evidence annotations (e.g., for ENO1, PGAM1, FBP1 in cytosol). While these are well-established localizations, they should ideally have evidence and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete \"part of\" Evidence**: Some activities have evidence for molecular function but are missing evidence for the \"part_of\" relationship to gluconeogenesis (GO:0006094). For example, SLC25A12's participation in gluconeogenesis lacks evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Evidence for Causal Relations**: None of the causal relationships (RO:0002413) have evidence annotations. Best practice would be to provide evidence for why one activity provides input for another.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex Considerations**: The model represents individual gene products rather than the complexes they may form. For example, some enzymes like pyruvate carboxylase can function as multimers. Consider checking if any of these enzymes should be represented as complexes according to GO-CAM complex annotation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Redundancy Check**: There are two glucose-6-phosphatase activities (G6PC1 and G6PC3) represented. While both are valid, it would be helpful to ensure their distinct roles are clear or if one is more relevant in the specific tissue context.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add missing evidence annotations for subcellular locations and \"part_of\" relationships.\n",
      "2. Add evidence for causal relationships between activities.\n",
      "3. Consider consulting the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document to check if any of these enzymes should be represented as complexes.\n",
      "4. Ensure that all transporter activities have clear evidence for their role in gluconeogenesis.\n",
      "5. Review the model for parsimony - ensure there's no redundancy or unnecessary steps that could be simplified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the gluconeogenesis pathway in mouse. With the minor improvements suggested, it would fully align with GO-CAM best practices.\n",

      "   - The causal associations using RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) are appropriate for this signaling pathway\n",
      "   - The flow is logical and consistent with known insulin signaling:\n",
      "     * Insulin ligands → Insulin receptor → Receptor tyrosine kinase activity → Adaptor proteins → Downstream signaling components\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence**:\n",
      "   - Most activities and causal associations are supported by primary literature references (e.g., PMID:8649419, PMID:8448209, PMID:23886629)\n",
      "   - Evidence codes are appropriate (e.g., ECO:0000314 for direct assay evidence, ECO:0000315 for mutant phenotype evidence)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signaling Receptor Annotation Guidelines**:\n",
      "   - The model correctly represents insulin (Ins1, Ins2) with receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018)\n",

      "\n",
      "I've identified a few potential issues in the model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Cellular Component Annotations**:\n",
      "   - Unlike the comparison model (gomodel:62b4ffe300004795), this model lacks cellular component annotations (e.g., plasma membrane for insulin receptor, extracellular space for insulin)\n",
      "   - According to best practices, cellular component annotations help specify where activities occur\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence Missing for Some Causal Associations**:\n",
      "   - Some causal associations lack evidence annotations, particularly:\n",
      "     * The connection between Insr protein tyrosine kinase activity (62d0afa500000608) and Irs1 adaptor activity (62d0afa500000610)\n",
      "     * The connection between Irs2 adaptor activity (62d0afa500000616) and Grb2 adaptor activity (62d0afa500000612)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream Signaling Pathway**:\n",
      "   - Compared to the example model (62b4ffe300004795), this model stops at Hras/protein-membrane adaptor activity and doesn't include the downstream MAP kinase cascade (MAPK1, MAPK3)\n",
      "   - However, this may be intentional as the focus might be on the initial steps of insulin signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Limited Biochemical Depth**:\n",
      "   - The model would benefit from additional annotations related to the specific interactions between components\n",

      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed model that accurately represents the insulin receptor signaling pathway in mouse. It follows most GO-CAM best practices for signaling pathway annotation, with proper use of molecular functions, biological processes, and causal relationships.\n",

      "5. **Molecular function terms**: The model uses appropriate molecular function terms for each protein, such as receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018) for IGF2, and specific kinase activities for the kinases in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Receptor-ligand relationship**: \n",
      "   - The model shows IGF2 (receptor ligand activity) having a causal relationship to IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor receptor activity), which aligns with guidelines.\n",
      "   - However, IGF1R is shown with both receptor activity (GO:0005010) and protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713) represented as separate activities, creating redundancy. According to signaling receptor guidelines, these should be modeled as a single activity unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing has_input relationship**: \n",
      "   - For the IGF1R receptor activity (GO:0005010), there's correctly a has_input relationship to ATP and has_output to ADP.\n",
      "   - However, a has_input relationship to its immediately downstream target (in this case Shc1) should be present but is missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adaptor protein annotation**: \n",
      "   - Grb2 is correctly annotated with \"guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor adaptor activity\" (GO:0005091)\n",
      "   - However, according to the \"How to annotate molecular adaptors\" guidelines, Grb2 should have \"has_input\" relationships to the molecules it brings together (likely Shc1 and Sos1), which are missing from the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence consistency**: \n",
      "   - Some activities lack evidence, especially causal associations (For example, the causal association between MAP2K activities and MAPK activities).\n",
      "   - Where evidence is present, most use appropriate ECO codes, but some evidence statements could be strengthened with more specific references.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **BP context**: \n",
      "   - All activities are correctly placed in the \"insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0048009), but more specific BP terms could potentially be used for some components.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cellular component context**: \n",
      "   - The model lacks cellular component annotations, which would be useful to specify the localization of the activities (e.g., membrane localization for receptor activities).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consolidate IGF1R activities**: Consider merging the insulin-like growth factor receptor activity (GO:0005010) and protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713) of IGF1R into a single activity unit with both causal relationships, as these represent the same functional entity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add missing has_input relationships**:\n",
      "   - Add a has_input relationship from IGF1R receptor activity to Shc1\n",
      "   - Add has_input relationships for the adaptor protein Grb2 to show the molecules it's bringing together\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complete evidence documentation**:\n",
      "   - Add evidence annotations to the causal associations that currently lack them\n",
      "   - Ensure consistent use of ECO terms across all annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add cellular component information**:\n",
      "   - Add \"occurs in\" plasma membrane for receptor activities\n",
      "   - Add appropriate cellular component terms for other activities in the cascade\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Verify completeness of branching**:\n",
      "   - The model appears to represent multiple MAPK pathways (including MAPK1/3 and MAPK7), but ensure all relevant branches of the pathway are included\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Consider using complex terms**: If any activities are carried out by protein complexes rather than individual proteins, it would be appropriate to use complex GO terms as outlined in the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guideline.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that effectively represents the IGF receptor signaling pathway in mouse. The model follows most of the expected GO-CAM best practices and accurately depicts the biological relationships between the components. With the recommended improvements, particularly regarding input/output relationships for adaptor proteins and the consolidation of receptor activities, this model would provide an even more accurate and useful representation of the pathway.\n",

      "## QC Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive Pathway Representation**: The model captures the key components and interactions of the canonical IGF-1 receptor signaling pathway, from ligand binding through PI3K activation to AKT activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Strong Evidence Base**: Multiple evidence types and publications support the model's assertions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper GO-CAM Conventions**: The model follows the GO-CAM representation guidelines for signaling receptor pathways as outlined in the documentation, with proper relationship types between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular Detail**: The model correctly distinguishes between the different subunits of PI3K (regulatory and catalytic) and their respective activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Metabolites in Ligand-Receptor Interaction**: While the model shows ATP → ADP in the receptor activity, this is a good practice for showing the molecular details of the kinase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Potentially Missing Outputs and Downstream Effects**: The model doesn't include the downstream effects of Akt1 activation. According to the literature (PMID:11784871), Akt activation leads to antiapoptotic effects and phosphorylation of numerous substrates, which could be included for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Annotations**: The biological context (cellular components) where each activity occurs is not specified, which could be added to improve the model's completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pathway Termination**: The pathway appears to end at Akt1 without indicating its downstream targets or biological outcomes. This makes it difficult to understand the ultimate biological effect of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the scientific literature on IGF-1 signaling. PMID:11784871 supports the role of PI3K in IGF-1 signaling and the requirement for a balance between regulatory and catalytic subunits. The sequence of events (ligand binding → receptor activation → adaptor recruitment → PI3K activation → PDK1/AKT activation) is well-established in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing signaling pathways. According to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\" document:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The proper relationship between ligand and receptor is represented\n",
      "2. The ligand (Igf1) has receptor ligand activity\n",
      "3. The receptor has insulin-like growth factor receptor activity\n",
      "4. The causal relation between ligand and receptor is \"directly positively regulates\"\n",
      "5. The receptor's input is properly represented as the effector protein it regulates (not its ligand)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Cellular Component Annotations**: Include cellular component information for each activity (e.g., plasma membrane for receptor, cytosol for downstream components).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Extend Downstream Effects**: Include key downstream substrates of Akt1 to show the biological outcomes of the pathway activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include Negative Regulators**: Consider adding negative regulators of the pathway such as phosphatases (e.g., PTEN) which are mentioned in the literature review (PMID:11784871).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Additional Cross-Regulation**: Include cross-talk with other signaling pathways where relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Include Feedback Mechanisms**: IGF signaling typically involves feedback regulation which could be represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:62e3212700000746 provides a solid representation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway in mouse. It accurately captures the core components of the pathway with appropriate molecular functions and causal relationships. The model follows GO-CAM best practices and is supported by strong evidence from the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model could be expanded to include more downstream effects and regulatory mechanisms, it serves as a valuable resource for understanding the fundamental components and organization of IGF-1 receptor signaling.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes the regulatory pathway through which OTUD3 (a deubiquitinase) regulates energy homeostasis in response to nutritional stress. The model shows how OTUD3 is acetylated by CREBBP (CBP), then deubiquitinates and stabilizes the nuclear receptor PPARD, which in turn regulates transcription of genes involved in energy metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The pathway in this model follows this sequence:\n",
      "1. CREBBP (CBP) acetyltransferase activity acetylates OTUD3\n",
      "2. Acetylated OTUD3 functions as a deubiquitinase in the nucleus\n",
      "3. OTUD3 deubiquitinates PPARD, preventing its degradation\n",
      "4. Stabilized PPARD acts as a DNA-binding transcription factor to regulate genes involved in energy homeostasis\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. CREBBP Activity (UniProtKB:Q92793)\n",
      "- **Activity**: Peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity (GO:0061733)\n",
      "- **Cellular Location**: Cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "- **Process**: N-terminal peptidyl-lysine acetylation (GO:0018076)\n",
      "- **Regulation**: Directly positively regulates CREBBP's second activity\n",
      "\n",
      "**Assessment**: This representation is accurate. CREBBP is known to acetylate various proteins, and according to the primary literature (PMID:35675826), glucose and fatty acids trigger CREBBP to acetylate OTUD3, promoting its nuclear translocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Secondary CREBBP Activity\n",
      "- **Activity**: Peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity (GO:0061733)\n",
      "- **Cellular Location**: Cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "- **Process**: N-terminal peptidyl-lysine acetylation (GO:0018076)\n",
      "- **Regulation**: Directly positively regulates OTUD3 deubiquitinase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "**Assessment**: This is appropriate and represents the same activity of CREBBP when directly regulating OTUD3.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. OTUD3 Activity (UniProtKB:Q5T2D3)\n",
      "- **Activity**: Cysteine-type deubiquitinase activity (GO:0004843)\n",
      "- **Cellular Location**: Nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "- **Process**: Protein K48-linked deubiquitination (GO:0071108)\n",
      "- **Regulation**: Directly positively regulates PPARD transcription factor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "**Assessment**: This is consistent with the evidence. OTUD3 deubiquitinates and stabilizes PPARD in the nucleus, particularly in response to nutritional stress according to PMID:35675826.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. PPARD Activity (UniProtKB:Q03181)\n",
      "- **Activity**: DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700)\n",
      "- **Cellular Location**: Nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "- **Process**: Regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (GO:0006357)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Assessment**: This representation is accurate. PPARD is indeed a nuclear transcription factor that regulates genes involved in energy metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is primarily supported by evidence from PMID:35675826, which appears to be a 2022 paper describing the role of OTUD3 in regulating metabolism homeostasis in response to nutritional stresses. The evidence is consistently applied across all activities with ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion).\n",
      "\n",
      "## QC Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. The model correctly captures the causal relationships in this regulatory pathway\n",
      "2. The cellular locations of each activity are accurately represented\n",
      "3. The evidence is consistently sourced and applied throughout the model\n",
      "4. The biological processes associated with each function are appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Improvements\n",
      "1. **Target Gene Specification**: According to the DNA-binding transcription factor annotation guidelines, each transcriptional target of PPARD should be captured as a separate activity unit with a \"has input\" relationship. The current model doesn't specify which genes PPARD regulates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular Context For OTUD3**: The model would benefit from adding that OTUD3 is acetylated (the result of CREBBP action) as context for its deubiquitinase activity. This would help capture that acetylation promotes OTUD3's nuclear localization.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Energy Homeostasis Process**: While the title mentions energy homeostasis (GO:0097009), this process isn't explicitly connected to any of the activities in the model. It would be valuable to connect the PPARD transcription factor activity to this process using a \"part of\" relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Nutritional Stress Response**: The model could be improved by indicating that this pathway is activated in response to nutritional stresses (e.g., glucose and fatty acids), which is a key aspect of the study referenced.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ubiquitination Status**: The model correctly notes that OTUD3 performs \"protein K48-linked deubiquitination\" on PPARD, but it would be informative to note that this prevents proteasomal degradation of PPARD, explicitly capturing the stabilization aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model (gomodel:62e3212700001890) successfully represents the regulatory pathway through which OTUD3 influences energy homeostasis by deubiquitinating and stabilizing PPARD following acetylation by CREBBP. The model is supported by appropriate evidence and follows most GO-CAM curation practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main recommendations for improvement involve adding more specific information about PPARD's transcriptional targets, explicitly connecting the pathway to energy homeostasis, and providing more context about the nutritional stress response. These changes would enhance the biological completeness of the model while maintaining its current strengths in representing the causal flow of the pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Process Context**: Each activity is placed within a biological process context.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues Requiring Attention:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Evidence**:\n",
      "   - The causal association between stalled ribosome sensor activity (62e3212700002085) and protein autophosphorylation (62e3212700001993) lacks evidence citations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Redundant Causal Association**:\n",
      "   - Duplicate causal relationship from GSDMD's phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding to wide pore channel activity (one with evidence, one without).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Model Entry Point**:\n",
      "   - While the title mentions UV-B irradiation and ribotoxic stress, these stimuli are not explicitly modeled as entry points in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex Representation**:\n",
      "   - The model doesn't show any protein complexes, though based on the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, this is appropriate if all individual subunit activities are known, as appears to be the case here.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pathway Completeness**: \n",
      "   - The pathway appears biologically complete from sensor to effector.\n",
      "   - The kinase cascade (MAP3K20 → MAP2K3/6 → MAPK11/14) is well-represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Signaling Logic**:\n",
      "   - The causal flow is logical and follows standard MAP kinase signaling paradigms.\n",
      "   - The connection to inflammasome activation and pyroptosis is well-established.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological Accuracy**:\n",
      "   - The model accurately represents the roles of MAP3K20 in stress signaling.\n",
      "   - The connection to NLRP1 inflammasome is consistent with recent literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Evidence for Missing Association**:\n",
      "   - Add literature evidence for the regulatory connection between MAP3K20's stalled ribosome sensor activity and its autophosphorylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Remove Redundant Association**:\n",
      "   - Remove the duplicate causal association without evidence between GSDMD's phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding and its wide pore channel activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider Adding Stimulus**:\n",
      "   - Consider explicitly modeling the UV-B irradiation and ribotoxic stress stimuli as starting points of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Verify Term Usage**:\n",
      "   - Confirm the appropriateness of GO:0170011 (stalled ribosome sensor activity) for MAP3K20 with recent literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider Overall Process Context**:\n",
      "   - Add an overarching biological process that encompasses the entire model, such as \"cellular response to UV-B\" (GO:0071493).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is technically sound and scientifically accurate, with good evidence support. With a few minor improvements to address the identified issues, it will be an excellent representation of the NLRP1 inflammasome activation pathway via MAP3K20 in response to cellular stress.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:62f58d8800000011](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:62f58d8800000011) describes \"Inactivation of GSDMD by Protease 3C from Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) (Human)\". This model represents how the viral protease 3C from Human enterovirus 71 inhibits pyroptosis by cleaving Gasdermin D (GSDMD), a key mediator of pyroptotic cell death.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GSDMD (UniProtKB:P57764)** performing:\n",
      "   - Wide pore channel activity (GO:0022829) - occurs in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding (GO:0005546) - occurs in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - Both activities are part of pyroptotic inflammatory response (GO:0070269)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Caspase-1 (UniProtKB:P29466)** performing:\n",
      "   - Cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004197) - occurs in the cytosol (GO:0005829)\n",
      "   - Part of protein maturation (GO:0051604)\n",
      "   - Positively regulates GSDMD's phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **EV71 Protease 3C (UniProtKB:Q66478)** performing:\n",
      "   - Cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004197)\n",
      "   - Part of symbiont-mediated suppression of host programmed cell death (GO:0052041)\n",
      "   - Negatively regulates GSDMD's wide pore channel activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Science Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientific content of the model is well-supported by current literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GSDMD's role in pyroptosis**: \n",
      "   - GSDMD is correctly represented as having pore-forming activity and membrane binding capabilities, particularly with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2).\n",
      "   - The model accurately depicts that GSDMD binds to the plasma membrane to form pores during pyroptosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Caspase-1 cleavage of GSDMD**:\n",
      "   - The literature confirms that inflammatory caspases, including Caspase-1, cleave GSDMD between its N-terminal and C-terminal domains.\n",
      "   - Caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD at Asp-275, releasing the N-terminal domain which forms membrane pores.\n",
      "   - The model correctly shows Caspase-1 positively regulating GSDMD activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **EV71 Protease 3C inactivation of GSDMD**:\n",
      "   - The model accurately depicts EV71 Protease 3C negatively regulating GSDMD's pore-forming activity.\n",
      "   - Lei et al. (2017, PMID:28679757) showed that Protease 3C cleaves GSDMD at the Q193-G194 pair, producing a shorter N-terminal fragment (GSDMD1-193) that cannot form pores or trigger pyroptosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "From a GO-CAM modeling perspective:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal relationships**: \n",
      "   - The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for Caspase-1's effect on GSDMD.\n",
      "   - It appropriately uses RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for EV71 Protease 3C's effect on GSDMD.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular activities**:\n",
      "   - Activities are properly annotated with cellular locations where they occur.\n",
      "   - The model properly connects molecular functions to biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence**:\n",
      "   - All activities are supported with experimental evidence (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence).\n",
      "   - Key references, including PMID:32109412 and PMID:28679757, provide direct experimental support for the causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues/Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is largely sound, I've identified a few areas that could be improved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cleavage site specificity**:\n",
      "   - The model could be enhanced by specifically noting that EV71 Protease 3C cleaves GSDMD at Q193-G194, which is different from the Caspase-1 cleavage site (D275).\n",
      "   - This molecular detail explains why the resulting GSDMD1-193 fragment cannot form functional pores.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mechanistic detail**:\n",
      "   - The model could better represent that the cleavage by Protease 3C produces a specific fragment (GSDMD1-193) that is incapable of forming pores.\n",
      "   - It could also highlight that this mechanism is different from normal GSDMD regulation where the N-terminal domain is released from autoinhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Contextual information**:\n",
      "   - Adding context about viral infection would strengthen the model, such as showing that this mechanism is part of viral immune evasion strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:62f58d8800000011 is a scientifically accurate and well-constructed model that represents current knowledge about how EV71 Protease 3C inactivates GSDMD to prevent pyroptosis during viral infection. The model correctly captures the molecular activities, cellular locations, and causal relationships between proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively demonstrates how viruses have evolved mechanisms to target host defense pathways, specifically by cleaving GSDMD at a non-canonical site to prevent its pore-forming activity and subsequent pyroptotic cell death. This mechanism allows the virus to evade this important innate immune defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "With minor additions of mechanistic detail regarding the specific cleavage site and the non-functional GSDMD fragment, this model would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this viral evasion mechanism.\n",

      "\n",
      "# GO-CAM Review: Insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway 4 (Mouse)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway in mouse (Taxon: NCBITaxon:10090). The model captures a signaling cascade starting with IGF2 (Igf2 Mmus) as a ligand binding to and activating the IGF1 receptor (Igf1r Mmus), leading to activation of downstream components including IRS1, PI3K (Pik3r1 and Pik3ca), PDPK1, and AKT1.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper causal relationships**: The model correctly uses the `RO:0002629` (directly positively regulates) predicate to connect activities in a signaling cascade, which aligns with GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate molecular functions**: Each protein has been assigned appropriate molecular functions:\n",
      "   - Igf2: receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018)\n",
      "   - Igf1r: insulin-like growth factor receptor activity (GO:0005010) and protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713)\n",
      "   - Irs1: transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase adaptor activity (GO:0005068)\n",
      "   - Pik3r1: kinase activator activity (GO:0019209)\n",
      "   - Pik3ca: 1-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity (GO:0016303)\n",
      "   - Pdpk1: 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase activity (GO:0004676)\n",
      "   - Akt1: protein serine kinase activity (GO:0106310)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence citations**: Most activities are supported by appropriate evidence and literature citations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process context**: All activities are correctly placed in the context of the \"insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0048009).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Small molecule handling**: The model appropriately captures ATP and ADP as inputs and outputs for the Igf1r receptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing cellular component context**: According to the signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines, activities should include cellular component information (e.g., 'occurs in' plasma membrane for transmembrane receptors). This information is missing for all activities in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence for causal relationships**: While most molecular functions have evidence, some causal associations lack evidence codes and citations. Specifically:\n",
      "   - The causal association between Igf1r protein tyrosine kinase activity and Irs1 adaptor activity has evidence, but several other causal relationships don't.\n",
      "   - The final activity (Akt1 serine kinase activity) has no outgoing causal associations, which is fine if it's the endpoint of this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing has_input relations**: According to the signaling receptor guidelines, a receptor should have the \"effector protein it regulates\" as its input using the 'has_input' relation. This is missing for some steps in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing evidence**: The GO:0106310 (protein serine kinase activity) assigned to Akt1 has no evidence citation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add cellular component annotations to activities, particularly for membrane proteins like IGF1R.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add evidence citations for all causal associations to strengthen the model's evidential support.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Review and add missing has_input relations where appropriate according to the guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Add evidence for the Akt1 protein serine kinase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Consider whether there are any additional steps in the pathway that could be added to make the model more comprehensive, if supported by evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway according to most GO-CAM best practices. The improvements suggested would enhance the model's compliance with guidelines and provide more complete information about the cellular locations and evidence base.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This model represents the process of insulin receptor recycling in mouse (NCBITaxon:10090), highlighting the molecular mechanisms involved in insulin receptor endocytosis, processing, and recycling. The model is in production status and focuses on several key proteins and complexes involved in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes these key activities:\n",
      "1. Protein binding by SORL1 (MGI:MGI:1202296)\n",
      "2. Endopeptidase activities by CTSD (MGI:MGI:88562) and IDE (MGI:MGI:96412)\n",
      "3. Protein tyrosine phosphatase activities by PTPN1 (MGI:MGI:97805) and PTPN2 (MGI:MGI:97806)\n",
      "4. Proton transmembrane transport by the V-type ATPase complex (GO:0033176)\n",
      "5. ATP hydrolysis by the V1 domain of the V-type ATPase complex (GO:0033180)\n",
      "6. Molecular function activator activity by ATP6AP1 (MGI:MGI:109629)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Well-supported evidence**: The model incorporates multiple evidence codes and literature references, primarily from PMID:27322061 which extensively describes the role of SORLA (SORL1) in insulin receptor trafficking and signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate cellular localization**: The activities are appropriately localized to relevant cellular components, with key processes occurring in the endosome lumen (GO:0031904) and endosome membrane (GO:0010008).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper complex annotation**: The V-type ATPase complex is correctly represented following GO-CAM guidelines for complexes. The activities are enabled by the appropriate complex components (V0 domain GO:0033179 and V1 domain GO:0033180) with their subunits properly listed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal connections**: The model effectively shows the causal relationships between activities using appropriate relationship predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing insulin binding**: The model does not explicitly represent the initial binding of insulin to its receptor, which is the trigger for the receptor internalization process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete representation of insulin signaling**: While the model focuses on insulin receptor recycling, it could benefit from connections to downstream insulin signaling pathways that are affected by changes in receptor recycling rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limited molecular details of sorting**: The molecular sorting mechanism of SORL1 could be more explicitly represented, showing how it interacts with the insulin receptor in the sorting process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is highly consistent with the referenced literature, particularly PMID:27322061, which describes how SORLA (SORL1) facilitates insulin receptor recycling by redirecting internalized receptor molecules from endosomes to the plasma membrane. The paper establishes that SORLA:\n",
      "- Interacts directly with the insulin receptor\n",
      "- Increases insulin receptor surface expression\n",
      "- Promotes insulin signaling in adipocytes\n",
      "- Prevents lysosomal degradation of the receptor\n",
      "- Enhances receptor recycling to the cell surface\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures these key aspects of the mechanism described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological content of the model is accurate and consistent with current understanding of insulin receptor trafficking. The inclusion of the V-type ATPase in endosomal acidification is appropriate, as acidification of endosomes is crucial for receptor sorting decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents:\n",
      "- The role of protein tyrosine phosphatases in insulin receptor signaling\n",
      "- The involvement of endopeptidases in insulin processing\n",
      "- The role of the V-type ATPase in creating the acidic environment needed for proper endosomal function\n",
      "- The importance of SORL1 in the receptor recycling pathway\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate use of GO terms**: The molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes are correctly represented using appropriate GO terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct evidence codes**: The model uses correct evidence codes (ECO terms) with appropriate references.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The causal relationships use correct relationship predicates (RO terms).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add insulin binding**: Include the initial insulin binding event to provide a complete picture of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expand on downstream effects**: Consider adding connections to show how altered receptor recycling affects insulin signaling outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include additional sorting components**: The model could benefit from including other known components of the endosomal sorting machinery that may interact with SORL1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add molecular details of SORL1-insulin receptor interaction**: Based on PMID:27322061, include more details about how SORL1 interacts with the insulin receptor and redirects it from the degradative to the recycling pathway.\n",

      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: PIV5-V Inhibition of STAT1 via DDB1/CUL4A (Human-Paramyxovirus)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model ID: [gomodel:62f58d8800001316](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:62f58d8800001316)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the molecular mechanism by which the V protein of Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) inhibits STAT1 function through a DDB1/CUL4A-mediated ubiquitination pathway. The model illustrates how viral proteins can hijack host cellular machinery to suppress interferon-mediated immune responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following key molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **DDB1 (UniProtKB:Q16531)** - Performs cullin family protein binding activity (GO:0097602)\n",
      "2. **CUL4A (UniProtKB:Q13619)** - Performs ubiquitin protein ligase binding (GO:0031625)\n",
      "3. **RBX1 (UniProtKB:P62877)** - Performs ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "4. **PIV5-V protein (UniProtKB:P11207)** - Performs ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity (GO:1990756)\n",
      "5. **STAT1 (UniProtKB:P42224)** - Performs DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0000981)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Logic and Causal Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents the causal flow of the mechanism:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PIV5-V protein acts as an adaptor for substrate recognition in the ubiquitin ligase complex\n",
      "2. DDB1 functions as a scaffold component that positively regulates RBX1\n",
      "3. CUL4A positively regulates RBX1's ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "4. RBX1 directly negatively regulates STAT1\n",
      "5. STAT1 is localized to the nucleus (GO:0005634) and functions in the type I interferon-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0060337)\n",
      "\n",
      "This causal flow correctly represents how the virus-encoded V protein hijacks the host cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex to target STAT1 for degradation, thereby suppressing interferon-mediated antiviral responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the established biological mechanism based on the cited literature. Key references such as PMID:16051811 describe how Paramyxovirus V proteins assemble STAT-specific ubiquitin ligase complexes from cellular components to target STAT proteins for degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationships between PIV5-V, DDB1, CUL4A, and the targeting of STAT1 are well-supported by the literature. PMID:16482215 and PMID:20870715 provide evidence for the role of these components in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activities and molecular functions**: Each protein is associated with an appropriate molecular function term.\n",
      "2. **Cellular context**: STAT1 is correctly annotated as occurring in the nucleus (GO:0005634).\n",
      "3. **Biological processes**: Activities are appropriately nested within relevant biological processes.\n",
      "4. **Causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates (RO:0002629 for \"directly positively regulates\" and RO:0002630 for \"directly negatively regulates\").\n",
      "5. **Evidence codes**: The model includes appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 for direct assay evidence) and PMIDs as references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I suggest the following improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **STAT1 activity detail**: The model could benefit from more detail about STAT1's specific gene targets in the interferon response pathway. The current representation shows STAT1's DNA-binding transcription factor activity but doesn't specify which genes it regulates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional biological context**: The model could be enhanced by including information about how STAT1 degradation specifically impairs interferon signaling. This could include downstream consequences such as inhibition of antiviral gene expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Temporal aspects**: The model could potentially include information about when during viral infection this mechanism is activated. This temporal context would provide additional biological insight.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Subcellular localization**: While STAT1 is correctly annotated as occurring in the nucleus, adding subcellular localization information for other components of the pathway would improve the model's completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complementary immune evasion mechanisms**: If applicable, the model could reference other immune evasion mechanisms employed by paramyxoviruses that work in conjunction with STAT1 degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:62f58d8800001316) effectively represents the molecular mechanism by which the PIV5-V protein inhibits STAT1 function through DDB1/CUL4A-mediated ubiquitination. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices and accurately reflects the current biological understanding as supported by the literature. With the suggested improvements, the model could provide an even more comprehensive representation of this virus-host interaction pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents an important immune evasion mechanism employed by paramyxoviruses to suppress interferon-mediated antiviral responses, making it a valuable resource for understanding virus-host interactions.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This is a production-status GO-CAM model titled \"Insulin processing 1 (Mouse)\" for the taxon *Mus musculus* (NCBITaxon:10090). It represents the insulin processing pathway, with 11 molecular activities connected through causal associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pathway Structure\n",
      "The model represents insulin processing, focusing on:\n",
      "1. Protein disulfide bond formation in the ER (Ero1b, P4hb)\n",
      "2. Zinc transport (Slc30a8, Slc30a5, Slc30a3)\n",
      "3. Proteolytic processing of proinsulin (Pcsk1, Pcsk2, Cpe)\n",
      "4. Insulin zinc binding (Ins2)\n",
      "5. Protein folding (Hsp90b1)\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow appears logical, connecting activities in a way that reflects the biological process of insulin maturation from the ER through secretory granules.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Quality\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes:\n",
      "- ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence)\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence)\n",
      "- ECO:0000316 (genetic interaction evidence)\n",
      "- ECO:0000266 (sequence orthology evidence)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each activity is supported by evidence from published literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Positive Aspects\n",
      "1. **Appropriate cellular locations**: Activities are annotated with proper cellular compartments (ER lumen, secretory granule, Golgi membrane)\n",
      "2. **Consistent causal relationships**: Uses appropriate causal predicates (RO:0002413 \"provides input for\", RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\")\n",
      "3. **Comprehensive representation**: All key steps in insulin processing are included\n",
      "4. **Species-specific model**: Correctly uses mouse gene identifiers (MGI)\n",
      "5. **Well-supported with evidence**: All activities have literature references\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "1. **Missing evidence for some causal associations**: Several causal associations have empty evidence arrays, including:\n",
      "   - From Pcsk1 to Cpe\n",
      "   - From Cpe to PC2\n",
      "   - From PC2 to Cpe\n",
      "   - From Cpe to Slc30a8\n",
      "   - From Hsp90b1 to P4hb\n",
      "   - From Slc30a5 to Ins2\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete activity connections**: Slc30a3 (zinc transporter) is part of the insulin processing but has no causal connections to other activities\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lack of complex representation**: The model appears to involve protein interactions but doesn't explicitly represent any complexes, which might be appropriate based on the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines if the activities are carried by individual proteins rather than complexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Gene Function Validation\n",
      "Let me look at some of the key protein roles in the model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ins2 (MGI:MGI:96573)** - annotated with zinc ion binding (GO:0008270) in insulin processing (GO:0030070), which is consistent with the known role of insulin binding zinc ions during maturation and storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Slc30a8 (MGI:MGI:2442682)** - annotated with zinc ion transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0005385) in secretory granule membrane (GO:0030667), which is accurate as this zinc transporter is known to be important for insulin packaging and secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **P4hb (MGI:MGI:97464)** - protein disulfide isomerase with reductase activity (GO:0015035) in ER lumen (GO:0005788), which is appropriate for its role in insulin folding.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "1. **Add evidence for all causal relationships**: Every causal association should have supporting evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complete the causal connections for Slc30a3**: This zinc transporter (MGI:MGI:1345280) should be causally connected to the pathway if it plays a role in insulin processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider annotation of potential complexes**: If any of these proteins function as complexes during insulin processing, consider using the complex annotation guidelines to represent them appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Verify the exact order of processing events**: Ensure the causal flow accurately reflects the temporal sequence of insulin processing from synthesis through maturation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents insulin processing in mouse. It follows most GO-CAM best practices, has good evidence support, and represents the biological process in a clear and logical manner. The main improvement would be adding evidence for all causal associations and connecting all activities properly within the pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis through the interaction between indole (a bacterial metabolite derived from tryptophan) and the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) pathway, including the downstream effects on IL-10 receptor signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model Title: Gut Microbiota tryptophan metabolism: Regulation of intestinal epithelial cell homesotasis by Indole-AhR (Human-E.coli)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary of Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains three main activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. AHR (P35869) - Nuclear receptor activity (GO:0004879) in the nucleus (GO:0005634), part of cellular response to molecule of bacterial origin (GO:0071219)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. ARNT (P27540) - DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) in the nucleus (GO:0005634), part of negative regulation of inflammatory response (GO:0050728)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. IL10RA (Q13651) - Interleukin-10 receptor activity (GO:0004920) in the apical plasma membrane (GO:0016324), part of negative regulation of inflammatory response (GO:0050728)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Description and Biology\n",
      "\n",
      "The model describes how indole, a metabolite produced by intestinal bacteria from tryptophan, functions as a ligand for AHR. When AHR is activated, it translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with ARNT to form a transcriptionally active complex. This complex regulates gene expression, including genes involved in anti-inflammatory responses, such as IL10RA. The IL-10 receptor signaling then contributes to intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships in the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. AHR directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) ARNT's transcription factor activity\n",
      "2. AHR provides input for (RO:0002407) IL10RA's receptor activity \n",
      "3. ARNT provides input for (RO:0002407) IL10RA's receptor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses evidence from several publications:\n",
      "- PMID:28602820 - Structural basis for AHR-mediated gene activation\n",
      "- PMID:29454749 - Likely related to AHR-ARNT interactions and downstream effects\n",
      "- PMID:24367025 - Details IL-10 receptor activity in intestinal epithelial cells\n",
      "- PMID:22087322 - Describes IL-10 receptor localization on apical plasma membrane\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence codes used include:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- ECO:0000305 (curator inference used in manual assertion)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model effectively captures the cross-kingdom signaling between bacterial metabolites (indole) and human AHR signaling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The causal relationships between AHR, ARNT, and IL10RA are supported by published evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The subcellular localization of the proteins is accurately represented (AHR and ARNT in the nucleus, IL10RA at the apical plasma membrane).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The biological process annotations are appropriate for each protein activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Small Molecule Representation**: The model doesn't explicitly represent indole (CHEBI:16881) as a small molecule activator of AHR, which is listed in the objects but not connected in the graph. According to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\", small molecule activators should be represented with the relation \"is small molecule activator of\".\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Add indole (CHEBI:16881) with a relation \"is small molecule activator of\" to the AHR nuclear receptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Improper Causal Relationship**: The \"provides input for\" (RO:0002407) relation is used between AHR and IL10RA, and between ARNT and IL10RA. However, according to the GO-CAM guidelines, this relation is typically used for substrates or targets, not for regulatory relationships. A more appropriate relation would be \"causally upstream of, positive effect\" (RO:0002304).\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Change the causal relationship from \"provides input for\" to \"causally upstream of, positive effect\" to better represent the indirect regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing IL-10 Ligand**: The IL10RA activity doesn't have an input for its ligand (IL-10). According to the signaling receptor guidelines, the receptor should have its ligand or downstream target as input.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Consider adding IL-10 as a receptor ligand that directly positively regulates IL10RA or add the downstream effector of IL10RA as its input.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **AHR-ARNT Complex**: The model represents AHR and ARNT as separate activities that interact through causal relationships, but according to the complex annotation guidelines, they form a functional heterodimer. This could be more accurately represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Consider representing the AHR-ARNT interaction as a heterodimer complex or ensure the current representation accurately captures that they function together.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Bacterial Component**: The model mentions E. coli in the title and includes objects related to bacterial processes (GO:0009034 tryptophanase activity, UniProtKB:P0A853, NCBITaxon:83333), but these aren't connected in the functional model.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Recommendation**: If bacterial tryptophanase activity converting tryptophan to indole is important to include, add this activity with appropriate connections to the rest of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively captures the cross-kingdom signaling between bacterial metabolites and human host response through the AHR pathway and downstream effects on IL-10 receptor signaling. It provides a good representation of how bacterial indole derived from tryptophan can influence intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis through AHR signaling and subsequent anti-inflammatory pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommended changes would enhance the model's completeness and adherence to GO-CAM standards, making it more informative and consistent with current annotation guidelines.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This model describes how glucose uptake and metabolism leads to the regulation of insulin secretion through a series of molecular events involving:\n",

      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing cellular context**: \n",
      "   - Although the model implies this is happening in pancreatic beta cells, there is no specific annotation indicating this. Consider adding \"occurs in\" CL:0000169 (type B pancreatic cell) to the activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete pathway**: \n",
      "   - The model includes the uptake of glucose, its phosphorylation, and regulation of ion channels, but it does not include the final step of insulin secretion itself. Consider extending the model to include insulin secretion as the terminal activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lacking connection to response process**: \n",
      "   - While activities are part of GO:0035774 \"positive regulation of insulin secretion involved in cellular response to glucose stimulus\", the connections between the calcium channels and the actual insulin secretion are not explicitly modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Small molecule representation**: \n",
      "   - Glucose is represented as a CHEBI term, but according to the guidelines on signaling receptor activity, small molecule activators should use \"is small molecule activator\" relation rather than \"has input\". This appears to be correctly modeled as \"has input\" between GLUT2 transporter and glucose.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Molecular details of regulation**:\n",
      "   - The model correctly shows direct negative regulation (RO:0002630) of the KATP channels in response to ATP binding, but could benefit from more detail about how increased ATP/ADP ratio leads to channel closure.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "After reviewing the relevant GO-CAM guidelines, I can confirm that this model follows most best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Regulation and regulatory processes**: The model correctly uses \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) and \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630) to show how one activity directly affects another.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex annotation**: The model correctly follows guidelines for annotating complexes by using GO complex IDs for voltage-gated calcium channel complexes where specific subunits carrying the activity are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Biological Knowledge\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately reflects the established biology of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Glucose is transported into beta cells via GLUT2 (Slc2a2)\n",
      "2. Glucose is phosphorylated by glucokinase (Gck)\n",
      "3. Increased ATP/ADP ratio leads to closure of KATP channels (Abcc8/Kcnj11)\n",
      "4. KATP channel closure leads to membrane depolarization\n",
      "5. Depolarization activates voltage-gated calcium channels\n",
      "6. Calcium influx triggers insulin secretion\n",
      "\n",
      "This pathway is well-supported by the literature citations included in the model, including PMID:10823833, PMID:7502040, and PMID:16924481.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is a good representation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. It correctly captures the key players and relationships in this process. The model could be improved by explicitly modeling the final step of insulin secretion and by clearly indicating the beta cell context.

      "## Summary of Model Content\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the process of protein import into peroxisomes mediated by the PEX5 receptor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The model depicts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The recognition and binding of PTS1-containing proteins by the PEX5 receptor in the cytosol\n",
      "2. Docking of the receptor-cargo complex to the peroxisomal membrane via PEX14\n",
      "3. Translocation of cargo proteins into the peroxisomal matrix\n",

      "   - Monoubiquitination of PEX5 by an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex at the peroxisomal membrane\n",
      "   - Extraction of ubiquitinated PEX5 by the AAA ATPase complex\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Scientific Literature\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the referenced literature, particularly PMID:35768507, which provides a detailed structural and functional characterization of the peroxisomal ubiquitin ligase complex (comprising PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12) that forms a retrotranslocation channel for recycling the PEX5 receptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships, molecular functions, and cellular locations depicted in the model are consistent with current understanding of peroxisomal protein import and receptor recycling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation against GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "### Complex Representation\n",
      "The model correctly follows GO-CAM guidelines for representing protein complexes:\n",
      "- When a specific subunit carries a known molecular activity, the activity is attributed to that subunit (e.g., PEX14's protein-macromolecule adaptor activity)\n",
      "- When activities are carried by complexes, appropriate complex identifiers are used (e.g., SGD:S000217793, SGD:S000217795, SGD:S000217796)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "The model appropriately uses causal relationships between activities:\n",
      "- RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\" is used correctly to connect activities in the pathway\n",
      "- The causal flow follows the biological sequence of events in peroxisomal protein import and receptor recycling\n",
      "\n",
      "### Annotation Quality\n",
      "- Evidence codes are properly applied (primarily ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence)\n",
      "- PMIDs are cited appropriately to support annotations\n",
      "- Multiple types of evidence are provided for key relationships\n",
      "- Appropriate part_of relationships link activities to biological processes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "### Minor Issues\n",
      "1. **Evidence for Causal Associations**: One causal association (between PEX14's adaptor activity and the Pex17/Pex14 complex's transporter activity) is lacking evidence code information. This should be added for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Component Consistency**: The model shows PEX5 operating in both cytosol (GO:0005829) and peroxisomal matrix (GO:0005782), which is appropriate given its shuttling nature, but the transition between these locations could be more explicitly modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Enhancements\n",
      "1. **Additional References**: While PMID:35768507 is extensively used, incorporation of some older foundational papers on PEX5 recycling would strengthen the model's evidence base.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Model Expansion**: The model could be expanded to include:\n",
      "   - The specific roles of the E2 enzyme (PEX4) in the ubiquitination process\n",
      "   - The fate of polyubiquitinated PEX5 in the RADAR pathway (Receptor Accumulation and Degradation in the Absence of Recycling)\n",
      "   - The import of PTS2-containing proteins (which involves PEX7)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "The GO-CAM model 62f58d8800002367 is a high-quality representation of the peroxisomal protein import and PEX5 receptor recycling pathway in yeast.

The model provides valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of peroxisomal protein import, particularly highlighting the role of the ubiquitin ligase complex in receptor recycling.\n",

      "### Model Structure and Content\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM represents the process of protein import into peroxisomes, specifically focusing on PTS1-containing proteins via the PEX5 receptor, and the recycling of the PEX5 receptor in humans. The model captures multiple molecular functions across different cellular compartments (cytosol, peroxisome membrane, peroxisomal matrix) with appropriate causal connections between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive Pathway Coverage**: The model thoroughly captures the peroxisomal protein import pathway, including receptor binding, docking, translocation, release, and receptor recycling steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper Cellular Compartmentalization**: Each activity is appropriately placed in its cellular location (cytosol, peroxisomal membrane, peroxisomal matrix).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence-Based Annotations**: Activities have appropriate evidence codes and literature references, with most annotations having direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal Flow Representation**: The activities are linked with appropriate causal relationships (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates) that accurately represent the flow of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Species-Specific Information**: The model is clearly identified as specific to humans (NCBITaxon:9606) with appropriate human proteins (UniProtKB entries).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Duplicate Causal Associations**: There appears to be some duplication in the causal associations. For example, the PEX26 protein (Q7Z412) has two identical causal associations to PEX1 (O43933), which seems redundant:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   {\"predicate\":\"RO:0002629\",\"downstream_activity\":\"gomodel:62f58d8800002485/62f58d8800002648\"}\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   appears twice in the PEX26 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Evidence in One Causal Association**: The causal association from PEX5's protein carrier chaperone activity (62f58d8800002527) to the subsequent activity has no evidence listed:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   \"causal_associations\":[{\"type\":\"CausalAssociation\",\"evidence\":[],\"predicate\":\"RO:0002629\",\"downstream_activity\":\"gomodel:62f58d8800002535\"}]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sequence Similarity Evidence**: Some annotations use sequence similarity evidence (ECO:0000250) with reference to yeast proteins. While acceptable, it would be preferable to have direct experimental evidence in humans where possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Similar Duplicate Causal Links**: The activity 62f58d8800002513 (PEX5 in peroxisomal matrix) has duplicate causal links to PEX12 (O00623), which could be consolidated:\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "   ```\n",
      "   appears twice in different evidence contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove Redundant Causal Associations**: Clean up duplicate causal associations that link to the same downstream activity with identical predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Missing Evidence**: Add appropriate evidence to the causal association from PEX5's protein carrier chaperone activity to the subsequent activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider Adding More Context**: While the model effectively represents the pathway, additional contextual information could be included, such as connections to related pathways or the consequences of peroxisomal protein import.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Review Literature for Direct Human Evidence**: Where sequence similarity evidence is used, consider reviewing more recent literature for direct experimental evidence in humans to strengthen the annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Verify Protein Transporter Annotations**: Ensure the protein transporter activity (GO:0140318) annotations are consistent with the latest GO guidelines for transporter activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a high-quality GO-CAM model that effectively represents the process of protein import into peroxisomes and PEX5 receptor recycling in humans. The model successfully captures the biological complexity of this process and follows most GO-CAM best practices.

      "# GO-CAM Model Review - gomodel:62f58d8800003012\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the positive regulation of insulin secretion pathway in mouse pancreatic beta cells, specifically focusing on the GPR40 (FFAR1)-mediated pathway that involves store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through the IP3R1/STIM1/Orai1 pathway. The model depicts how long-chain fatty acids potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological Accuracy**: The model accurately represents the current understanding of GPR40/FFAR1 signaling in pancreatic beta cells as documented in the literature (PMID:31664108). The pathway from G-protein coupled receptor activation through to calcium channel regulation is well-represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper Evidence Annotation**: Most activities and relationships are supported by appropriate experimental evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular Detail**: The model includes appropriate molecular details, including relevant inputs (such as IP3 and DAG) and causal relationships between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological Process Context**: All activities are properly situated within the broader biological process (GO:0007200 - phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Causal Association Evidence**: There's a causal association between Orai1 (MGI:MGI:1925542) activity and TRPC1 (MGI:MGI:109528) activity that lacks evidence annotation. This should be supported with appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Location Annotations**: While most activities have appropriate cellular location annotations (plasma membrane, GO:0005886), some activities lack these annotations. For example, IP3R1 activity would typically occur at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, but this location is not specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological Process Consistency**: While all activities are annotated to GO:0007200 (phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway), the title of the model is \"Positive regulation of insulin secretion 2 (Mouse)\". It would be beneficial to explicitly link this to insulin secretion in the model (GO:0030073) to better match the stated purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complete Input/Output Relationships**: While some reactions in the model have appropriate input/output molecule associations (e.g., PLC activity with PIP2 input and IP3/DAG outputs), others are missing potential input/output annotations that would enhance the model's clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Incomplete Pathway**: The model shows the pathway up to TRPC1 activity but does not complete the connection to insulin secretion, which would provide a more comprehensive representation of the title process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence Codes**: The model appropriately uses evidence codes like ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence used in manual assertion) and ECO:0000266 (sequence orthology evidence used in manual assertion) to support the assertions, which is good practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regulatory Relationships**: The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) to represent the causal relationships between activities in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete the Pathway**: Consider extending the model to show how the SOCE pathway ultimately leads to insulin secretion, which would complete the story suggested by the model title.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include Glucose Dependency**: The literature (PMID:31664108) emphasizes that GPR40-mediated potentiation of insulin secretion is glucose-dependent. This aspect could be better represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add Cellular Compartmentalization**: The model would benefit from more precise cellular location annotations, particularly for IP3R1, which functions at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (https://bioregistry.io/go.model:62f58d8800003012) provides a good representation of the GPR40/FFAR1 signaling pathway that leads to store-operated calcium entry in pancreatic beta cells.

      "This pathway is well-supported by the scientific literature, particularly the key papers referenced in the model (PMID:26344566 and PMID:27597759).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation of Model Structure and Relations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following key activities and causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PEX5 (P50542) functions as a \"peroxisome matrix targeting signal-1 binding\" (GO:0005052) protein in the cytosol\n",
      "2. PEX5 then functions as a \"protein carrier chaperone\" (GO:0140597) in both the cytosol and peroxisomal matrix\n",
      "3. PEX5 is connected to peroxisomal membrane proteins PEX14 and PEX13 which have \"protein transmembrane transporter activity\" (GO:0008320)\n",
      "4. ATM (Q13315) functions as a \"protein serine/threonine kinase activity\" (GO:0004674) in the peroxisomal matrix\n",
      "5. PEX2 (P28328) has \"ubiquitin protein ligase activity\" (GO:0061630) at the peroxisomal membrane\n",
      "6. SQSTM1 (Q13501) has \"protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\" (GO:0030674) in the cytosol\n",
      "\n",
      "These connections correctly represent the pathway described in the literature where:\n",
      "- PEX5 serves as the receptor for peroxisomal matrix protein import\n",
      "- ATM is imported into peroxisomes and phosphorylates PEX5\n",
      "- PEX2 ubiquitinates PEX5, marking peroxisomes for degradation via pexophagy\n",
      "- SQSTM1 (p62) serves as the autophagy receptor that recognizes ubiquitinated peroxisomal proteins\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relations in the model use appropriate predicates:\n",
      "- \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) is correctly used to indicate direct regulatory relationships\n",
      "- \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) is appropriately used where one activity provides substrate for another\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are properly connected in the correct sequential order that matches the biological pathway as described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular adaptor activities and complexes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular adaptor activity representation**: PEX5 is correctly annotated as \"protein carrier chaperone\" and SQSTM1 as \"protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\", consistent with the guidelines in the \"Molecular adaptor activity\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Subcellular locations**: All activities are properly annotated with their correct cellular locations (cytosol, peroxisomal matrix, or peroxisomal membrane).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **E3 ubiquitin ligase**: PEX2 is correctly annotated with \"ubiquitin protein ligase activity\" (GO:0061630), which is appropriate for an E3 ligase.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **PEX interactions**: The interactions between PEX5, PEX14, and other peroxisomal proteins are represented accurately, matching their known roles in peroxisomal protein import.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, here are a few suggestions for potential improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Explicit ROS representation**: The model could benefit from explicitly representing the ROS stimulus that activates ATM in peroxisomes. This could be done by including a \"cellular response to reactive oxygen species\" (GO:0034614) biological process annotation to the ATM activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Phosphorylation details**: The model could be more specific about the site of PEX5 phosphorylation by ATM. According to the literature (PMID:26344566), ATM phosphorylates PEX5 at Ser141, which is an important detail for the biological mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ubiquitination specificity**: The model could be more specific about which lysine residue of PEX5 is ubiquitinated by PEX2. According to the literature (PMID:26344566), PEX5 is monoubiquitinated at Lys209, which is critical for recruiting SQSTM1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Downstream autophagy machinery**: The model could be extended to include additional components of the autophagy machinery that act downstream of SQSTM1 to complete the pexophagy process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:62f58d8800003277) accurately represents the current understanding of ATM-mediated pexophagy in response to ROS. The model captures the key molecular players and their causal relationships in a manner consistent with GO-CAM best practices. The biochemical content is well-aligned with the primary literature, and the model provides a clear representation of this important cellular pathway for peroxisome quality control.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully connects the activities of PEX5, ATM, PEX2, and SQSTM1 to illustrate how reactive oxygen species trigger a signaling cascade that leads to selective autophagy of peroxisomes, a crucial process for maintaining cellular homeostasis under oxidative stress conditions.\n",

      "### Summary\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents a signaling pathway involved in the positive regulation of insulin secretion in mouse pancreatic beta cells, focusing on G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor (Chrm3) activation leading to phospholipase C signaling, which ultimately contributes to insulin secretion. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pathway Representation**: \n",
      "   - The model correctly depicts the main components of the acetylcholine signaling pathway in beta cells: M3 muscarinic receptor (Chrm3) → G proteins (Gnaq, Gna11) → phospholipase C-beta (Plcb1) → PKC (Prkcb)\n",
      "   - The causal relationships use the appropriate predicate \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629)\n",
      "   - Activities are correctly associated with the \"phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0007207)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular Function Annotations**:\n",
      "   - Appropriate GO terms are used for each activity:\n",
      "     - Chrm3: \"G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor activity\" (GO:0016907)\n",
      "     - Gnaq/Gna11: \"G protein activity\" (GO:0003925)\n",
      "     - Plcb1: \"phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C activity\" (GO:0004435)\n",
      "     - Prkcb: \"calcium,diacylglycerol-dependent serine/threonine kinase activity\" (GO:0004698)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Support**:\n",
      "   - The model is well-supported by appropriate evidence codes and literature references\n",
      "   - The evidence for Plcb1's role includes direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) from PMID:9762362\n",
      "   - The G protein activities are supported by sequence orthology evidence (ECO:0000266) with human counterparts\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biochemical Detail**:\n",
      "   - The model correctly shows inputs and outputs for Plcb1, including PIP2 (REACTO_R-ALL-179856) as input and DAG (REACTO_R-ALL-114519) and IP3 (REACTO_R-ALL-114520) as outputs\n",
      "   - This biochemical detail accurately reflects the phospholipase C catalytic activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incomplete Insulin Secretion Pathway**:\n",
      "   - Despite the model's title referring to \"Positive regulation of insulin secretion,\" the causal chain ends with PKC activation (Prkcb) without explicitly connecting to insulin secretion\n",
      "   - The biological process term \"insulin secretion\" (GO:0030073) is present in the model objects but not used in the activity annotations\n",
      "   - The literature evidence (PMID:27226533) discusses PKC's role in insulin secretion, but this final connection is missing from the model\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Location Details**:\n",
      "   - All activities are annotated as occurring at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), which is correct, but the model would benefit from including the cellular context of type B pancreatic cells (CL:0000169), which is listed in the model objects but not used in annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Unused Entity in Model**:\n",
      "   - MGI:MGI:96907 (Marcks Mmus) is listed in the objects but not used in any activity in the model\n",
      "   - The literature (PMID:27226533) specifically mentions MARCKS as a PKC substrate involved in this pathway, suggesting that this should be included as a downstream component\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing Regulatory Mechanisms**:\n",
      "   - The model doesn't capture the autocrine regulation aspect discussed in PMID:27226533, where exocytosis of insulin granules leads to ATP release, which activates P2Y1 receptors to generate DAG spikes\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete the Pathway to Insulin Secretion**:\n",
      "   - Add a downstream activity representing insulin secretion (GO:0030073)\n",
      "   - Connect PKC (Prkcb) activity to this insulin secretion activity using the appropriate causal relation (RO:0002304 - causally upstream of, positive effect)\n",
      "   - Include the cellular location as type B pancreatic cell (CL:0000169)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add MARCKS as a PKC Substrate**:\n",
      "   - Include the phosphorylation of MARCKS (MGI:MGI:96907) by PKC as this is a key downstream event\n",
      "   - Based on PMID:27226533, MARCKS phosphorylation is directly linked to exocytosis machinery regulation\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expand the Model to Include Autocrine Signaling**:\n",
      "   - Consider adding additional entities to represent the autocrine feedback loop described in the literature, where insulin exocytosis leads to ATP release and P2Y1 receptor activation\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Input/Output Molecules for Additional Activities**:\n",
      "   - Include input/output specifications for G protein and PKC activities to improve model clarity, similar to what was done for Plcb1\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Positive regulation of insulin secretion 4 (Mouse)\" provides a good representation of the early steps in the G protein-coupled acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway that contributes to insulin secretion in mouse pancreatic beta cells. The model correctly depicts the causality from receptor activation to PKC activation through G proteins and phospholipase C, with appropriate molecular function terms and evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the model would benefit from explicit connection to insulin secretion as the ultimate outcome, inclusion of MARCKS as a PKC substrate, and representation of the cellular context in type B pancreatic cells. These additions would make the model more complete and better aligned with its title and the supporting literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these suggested improvements, the model represents a valuable contribution to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of insulin secretion and follows GO-CAM best practices for most aspects of its construction.\n",

      "# GO-CAM Model Review: gomodel:62f58d8800004529\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This model represents the positive regulation of insulin secretion in mouse, focusing on a cAMP-dependent pathway involving GLP-1 receptor signaling and downstream molecular events leading to insulin secretion. The model was created in 2022 and describes interactions among several key proteins including GLP-1 receptor (Glp1r), G proteins (Gnas, Rap1a, Rap1b), adenylate cyclase (Adcy8), cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rapgef4/EPAC2), and Rim2 (Rims2), culminating in insulin secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly represents a well-documented pathway of GLP-1 receptor-mediated insulin secretion, consistent with the literature referenced (PMID:11056535).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The causal relationships between activities are generally well-defined using the appropriate predicates (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence**: Each assertion is backed by experimental evidence with appropriate ECO codes and PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Completeness**: The model captures the full pathway from ligand-receptor interaction to the effector function (insulin secretion).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular adaptor annotation**:\n",
      "   - Rapgef4 (MGI:MGI:1917723) is shown with two separate activities: guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity (GO:0005085) and protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674). \n",
      "   - According to the \"How to annotate molecular adaptors\" guidelines, an adaptor should include \"has input\" annotations for the molecules it brings together. The current model doesn't specify these inputs for the adaptor activity.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Add \"has_input\" relationships to specify which molecules Rapgef4 brings together when functioning as an adaptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular compartment annotations**:\n",
      "   - While some activities have \"occurs_in\" compartment annotations, not all do. For instance, GCG (glucagon) activity lacks a cellular location.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Add appropriate cellular compartment information for all activities where known.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Minor annotation inconsistencies**:\n",
      "   - The Rims2 protein (MGI:MGI:2152972) has \"molecular_function\" annotated as GO:0003674 (molecular function), which is a root term. This is generally not recommended as it doesn't provide specific functional information.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: If the specific molecular function is known, replace GO:0003674 with a more specific term.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pathway visualization consideration**:\n",
      "   - The model includes parallel pathways with Rap1a and Rap1b, which both perform G protein activity. This is biologically accurate but might make the model slightly more complex to interpret.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Consider adding a comment to clarify the functional redundancy of these two proteins in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Literature integration**:\n",
      "   - While the model cites PMID:11056535 which provides evidence for the Rapgef4-Rims2 interaction, it would be valuable to integrate more recent literature that may have further characterized this pathway.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Consider updating the model with more recent references if available.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly implements GO-CAM best practices regarding:\n",
      "- Use of proper molecular function terms\n",
      "- Appropriate causal relationship predicates\n",
      "- Connection of activities to create a coherent biological pathway\n",
      "- Grounding assertions in experimental evidence\n",
      "- Species-specificity (correctly annotated as mouse)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of GLP-1 receptor-mediated insulin secretion in mouse pancreatic beta cells. The model provides a valuable resource for understanding this signaling pathway. With minor improvements to the annotations as suggested above, it would be even more comprehensive and useful to the research community.\n",

      "### Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes the GLP-1 receptor signaling pathway that regulates insulin secretion in mouse pancreatic beta cells. The model captures the molecular cascade from GLP-1 binding to its receptor through multiple downstream effectors that ultimately lead to insulin secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Structure Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model appropriately represents a signaling pathway with the following components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Glucagon (Gcg)** acting as a receptor ligand (GO:0048018) to activate the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R)\n",
      "2. **GLP-1 receptor (Glp1r)** with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor activity (GO:0044508) at the plasma membrane\n",
      "3. **G-protein signaling (Gnas)** with adenylate cyclase activator activity (GO:0010856)\n",
      "4. **Adenylyl cyclase (Adcy8)** generating cAMP from ATP\n",
      "5. **Protein kinase A (Prkaca)** with cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (GO:0004691)\n",
      "6. **Snapin** as a protein-macromolecule adaptor (GO:0030674)\n",
      "7. **Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7)** with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding activity (GO:0005546)\n",
      "8. **PKA regulatory subunit (Prkar1a)** with inhibitory function (GO:0004862)\n",
      "9. **CREB transcription factor (Creb1)** with DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0000981)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence-Based Annotations**: Each activity is backed by experimental evidence with appropriate ECO codes and PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper Causal Relationships**: The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) to show the causal flow from receptor activation to downstream effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Context**: The model properly locates activities in their cellular compartments (e.g., GLP-1R at the plasma membrane).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Substrate Specification**: The model correctly identifies ATP as the input and cAMP as the output for adenylate cyclase.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Common Biological Process**: All activities are appropriately situated within the common biological process \"adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0007189).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Evidence for Causal Links**: The causal associations have evidence codes and references (e.g., the link between PKA and Snapin is backed by PMID:21356520).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Potassium Channel Context**: The Kcnj11 protein (MGI:MGI:107501) with inward rectifying potassium channel activity (GO:0008282) appears in the model but lacks clear causal connections to other components. From the literature (PMID:33196462), this is a likely target of the pathway and should be causally connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Outcomes**: While the model shows the pathway events, it doesn't explicitly connect the final steps to the biological process of insulin secretion (GO:0030073), which is mentioned in some activity annotations but not as a pathway output.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Temporal Dynamics**: The model doesn't capture the temporal aspects of insulin secretion (first vs. second phase) that are clearly described in the papers (particularly PMID:21356520).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complete Causal Chain**: The model has some \"gaps\" in causal links. For instance, how the Creb1 transcription factor functionally connects to the other components isn't explicit in the causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model aligns well with the current understanding of GLP-1 signaling in beta cells as described in the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The papers (PMID:25830090, PMID:21356520) support the role of the GLP-1R in potentiating insulin secretion via cAMP elevation and PKA activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The importance of Snapin phosphorylation by PKA (Ser50) in insulin secretion is well-supported by PMID:21356520, and this is reflected in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The inhibitory role of Prkar1a on PKA activity and subsequent effects on insulin secretion is consistent with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Model Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete the Causal Chain**: Add a causal link between PKA and CREB1 to show how PKA activates this transcription factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Connect to Physiological Outcome**: Add explicit connections to show how this pathway ultimately leads to insulin secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include the Potassium Channel Connection**: Clarify how Kcnj11 fits into the pathway, likely as a target of PKA or another component.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Missing Components**: Consider adding SNAP-25 and VAMP2, which are mentioned in PMID:21356520 as important components of the exocytosis machinery that interact with Snapin.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Temporal Aspects**: Consider annotating or commenting on the model to indicate which components are particularly important for first-phase versus second-phase insulin secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows most GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ✅ Uses appropriate molecular function terms\n",

      "\n",
      "# GO-CAM Model Review: gomodel:632cf60a00000169\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "The model [gomodel:632cf60a00000169](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:632cf60a00000169) depicts how Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) protein ICP0 modulates interferon production through the degradation of host protein MORC3. This represents an important viral immune evasion mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains four key molecular activities connected in a causal pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ICP0 (UniProtKB:P08393) - E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "2. MORC3 (UniProtKB:Q14149) - DNA binding activity (GO:0003677)\n",
      "3. MORC3 (UniProtKB:Q14149) - Protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674)\n",
      "4. IFNB1 (UniProtKB:P01574) - Cytokine activity (GO:0005125)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current scientific understanding of how HSV-1 ICP0 suppresses the host's interferon response:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ICP0 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets host proteins for degradation\n",
      "2. MORC3 is a nuclear protein that normally restricts viral replication and has dual functions:\n",
      "   - DNA binding activity, which represses transcription\n",
      "   - Adaptor activity in nuclear/PML bodies\n",
      "3. By degrading MORC3, ICP0 prevents its antiviral functions, which include regulating type I interferon production\n",
      "4. The suppression of MORC3's activities leads to inhibition of IFNB1 (interferon beta) production\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the literature, particularly the papers by Gaidt et al. (2021, Nature) and Sloan et al. (2016, J Virol), which demonstrate that MORC3 has both direct antiviral activity and participates in a \"self-guarding\" mechanism where its degradation can trigger IFN production through de-repression of a MORC3-regulated element near IFNB1.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and GO-CAM Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper causal connections**: The model correctly uses the appropriate causal predicates:\n",
      "   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) to show ICP0's inhibitory effect on both MORC3 activities\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular components**: All activities are annotated with their appropriate cellular locations:\n",
      "   - ICP0 in host cell nucleus (GO:0042025)\n",
      "   - MORC3 DNA binding in chromatin (GO:0000785)\n",
      "   - MORC3 adaptor activity in PML body (GO:0016605)\n",
      "   - IFNB1 in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological processes**: Each activity is appropriately placed within a relevant biological process:\n",
      "   - ICP0: \"suppression by virus of host type I interferon production\" (GO:0039501)\n",
      "   - MORC3 DNA binding: \"negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II\" (GO:0000122)\n",
      "   - MORC3 adaptor: \"antiviral innate immune response\" (GO:0140374)\n",
      "   - IFNB1: \"type I interferon-mediated signaling pathway\" (GO:0060337)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence codes**: All annotations include appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I identified a few areas that could be improved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete pathway representation**: The model could more explicitly show how MORC3 degradation leads to de-repression of the MORC3-regulated element (MRE) adjacent to the IFNB1 locus. According to Gaidt et al. (2021), this is a key mechanism by which MORC3's \"self-guarding\" function operates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional molecular functions**: The model currently depicts MORC3 with two activities, but could potentially include its ATPase activity, which is involved in its localization to nuclear bodies and function.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional participants**: The model could include other proteins that interact with MORC3 in PML nuclear bodies, such as PML itself, which would provide a more complete picture of the nuclear body component of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Downstream effects**: The model could be extended to show the downstream effects of IFNB1 signaling through the IFNAR receptor and JAK-STAT pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by evidence with appropriate literature citations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- PMID:15247261 for ICP0's ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "- PMID:34759314 for MORC3's DNA binding and adaptor functions\n",

      "- PMID:18035482 for IFNB1's role in type I interferon signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "All references are appropriate and relevant for the specific annotations they support.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The model gomodel:632cf60a00000169 provides an accurate representation of how HSV-1 ICP0 modulates interferon production via MORC3 degradation. It follows GO-CAM best practices and is well-supported by scientific evidence. The model successfully captures a key viral immune evasion mechanism through proper use of molecular activities, cellular components, biological processes, and causal connections.\n",
      "\n",

The model contains three main molecular activities and their causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Entities and Their Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. USP18 (UniProtKB:Q9UMW8)\n",
      "- **Function**: Molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090)\n",
      "- **Location**: Cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "- **Process**: Antiviral innate immune response (GO:0140374)\n",
      "- **Evidence**: Direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) from PMID:27801882\n",
      "- **Causal relationship**: Directly positively regulates USP20's deubiquitinase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "USP18 is correctly annotated as having a molecular adaptor activity, which is consistent with the literature showing it functions as a non-enzymatic adaptor that recruits USP20 to STING.\n",

      "### 2. USP20 (UniProtKB:Q9Y2K6)\n",
      "- **Function**: Cysteine-type deubiquitinase activity (GO:0004843)\n",
      "- **Location**: Cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "- **Process**: Antiviral innate immune response (GO:0140374)\n",
      "- **Evidence**: Direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) from PMID:19424180\n",
      "- **Causal relationship**: Directly positively regulates STING's cyclic GMP-AMP binding\n",
      "\n",
      "USP20 is correctly annotated with deubiquitinase activity, which is responsible for removing K48-linked ubiquitin chains from STING.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. STING1 (UniProtKB:Q86WV6)\n",
      "- **Function**: 2',3'-cyclic GMP-AMP binding (GO:0061507)\n",
      "- **Location**: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane (GO:0005789)\n",

      "STING1 is correctly annotated as having cyclic GMP-AMP binding activity, which is a key function in DNA-sensing pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate representation of biological process**: The model correctly depicts the USP18-USP20-STING relationship described in the literature. USP18 functions as an adaptor to recruit USP20, which then deubiquitinates and stabilizes STING.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate evidence citations**: Each activity and relationship is supported by appropriate published evidence with direct assay evidence codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct subcellular locations**: The subcellular locations for the proteins are correctly annotated based on the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Correct causal relationships**: The model uses the appropriate causal predicate RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) to represent the activating relationship between USP18 and USP20, and between USP20 and STING1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing K48-linked ubiquitination details**: The model does not explicitly indicate that USP20 removes K48-linked ubiquitin chains from STING, which is a key mechanistic detail from the Zhang et al. (2016) paper. Consider adding this specificity to the annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing representation of STING stabilization outcome**: While the model shows that USP20 activity positively regulates STING, it doesn't explicitly represent the stabilization of STING protein levels as an outcome. Consider adding an annotation to represent this functional consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Potential redundancy in causal associations**: USP20 has two identical causal associations to STING1 (identical predicate and target), which appears to be redundant and should be consolidated into a single relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing functional consequence of STING activity**: The model could be expanded to show what happens downstream of STING activation - specifically the induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines as described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complex representation considerations**: According to GO-CAM best practices for annotating complexes, since USP18-USP20 function together but have distinct activities, they are correctly represented as separate entities. However, the model could more clearly represent their physical interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is largely consistent with the findings reported in the key references:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Zhang et al. (2016) showed that USP18 functions as an adaptor to recruit USP20 to deubiquitinate STING in a manner independent of USP18's enzymatic activity.\n",
      "- The model captures the essential relationship that USP20 deubiquitinates STING, leading to STING stabilization.\n",
      "- The function of STING in binding cyclic dinucleotides like 2',3'-cGAMP is accurately represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary and Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:632cf60a00000788 provides a good representation of the USP18-USP20-STING pathway in antiviral innate immune responses. It accurately captures the key molecular activities and their causal relationships. The model uses appropriate GO terms, evidence codes, and citations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the model, I recommend:\n",
      "1. Adding explicit annotation of K48-linked deubiquitination\n",
      "2. Including the stabilization of STING protein levels as an outcome\n",
      "3. Resolving the redundant causal association from USP20 to STING1\n",
      "4. Extending the model to include downstream activation of IRF3/NF-κB and type I interferon production\n",
      "5. More clearly representing the physical interaction between USP18 and USP20\n",

      "3. The biological process context is consistently annotated for each activity as \"phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0007200).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The input/output molecules for phospholipase C activity are properly annotated (PIP2 → DAG + IP3).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The evidence for each activity is appropriately referenced with PMIDs and evidence codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues Identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Small Molecule Ligand**: While the model implies that the FFAR2 receptor is activated by acetate (according to the literature), the small molecule activator is not explicitly represented in the model. According to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\", small molecule activators should be linked to the receptor activity with the relation \"is small molecule activator\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete Pathway Context**: The model title mentions \"Positive regulation of insulin secretion\", but there's no explicit connection to insulin secretion (GO:0030073) in the model. The pathway ends with the IP3 receptor activity without showing how this leads to insulin secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Context**: There's no indication that these activities occur in pancreatic beta cells (CL:0000169), which would be important for the proper contextual understanding of insulin secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing Final Output**: The model doesn't show how IP3 receptor activation leads to calcium release and ultimately insulin secretion, leaving the pathway incomplete.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **FFAR2 Receptor Input/Target**: According to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\", the receptor's target should be the effector protein it regulates (G-proteins in this case), which should be captured with a 'has input' relation. This relationship appears to be missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Small Molecule Activator**: Connect acetate (CHEBI:30089) to the FFAR2 receptor activity using the \"is small molecule activator\" relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complete the Pathway**: Add the downstream activities showing how IP3 receptor activation leads to calcium release, which then triggers insulin secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add Cellular Context**: Explicitly annotate that these activities occur in pancreatic beta cells (CL:0000169).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add FFAR2 Receptor Input**: Add the 'has input' relation from the FFAR2 receptor to its G-protein targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Connect to Insulin Secretion**: Add activities that connect the IP3 receptor to insulin secretion (GO:0030073) to complete the biological process context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "The model [gomodel:633b013300000089](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:633b013300000089) presents a well-structured GPCR signaling pathway that leads to IP3 receptor activation. It correctly represents the molecular activities and their relationships in the pathway. However, the model could be improved by adding the small molecule activator, including the complete pathway to insulin secretion, and providing the cellular context of pancreatic beta cells. With these additions, the model would better represent the biological process of positive regulation of insulin secretion mediated by FFAR2 in mice.\n",

      "\n",
      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: Tricarboxylic acid cycle 1 (Mouse)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This model captures the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in mouse, representing the sequence of enzyme activities that make up this metabolic pathway. The model includes all key enzymes in the cycle, their molecular functions, inputs/outputs, cellular locations, and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete pathway representation**: The model captures all the major enzymatic steps of the TCA cycle, with appropriate molecular functions assigned to each enzyme or enzyme complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex representation**: The model correctly uses protein complexes (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase complex, succinate dehydrogenase complex) with their component subunits listed, following the best practices for complex annotation in GO-CAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence and literature support**: Each activity is supported by appropriate literature references with evidence codes (e.g., ECO:0000314 for direct assay evidence, ECO:0000315 for mutant phenotype evidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Subcellular localization**: The activities are appropriately localized to the mitochondrial matrix (GO:0005759) or mitochondrion (GO:0005739), consistent with the known location of the TCA cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Input/output molecules**: The model clearly specifies the chemical inputs and outputs for each reaction using REACTO identifiers for metabolites.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Causal connections**: The model uses RO:0002413 (\"provides input for\") to show the sequential flow of the TCA cycle reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Regulatory component**: The model includes a regulatory element with Sirt3 (MGI:MGI:1927665) protein deacetylase activity positively regulating succinate dehydrogenase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Automated changes**: The model includes comments about automated changes to some GO terms (GO:0005962 replaced by GO:0045242 and GO:0045257 replaced by GO:0045273). This is good practice for documenting term updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular compartment annotation**: While most activities are correctly annotated to occur in the mitochondrial matrix (GO:0005759), the activity for MGI:MGI:1927665 (Sirt3) lacks a cellular location annotation. Consider adding this for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological process annotation**: Some activities are missing explicit \"part_of\" associations to the TCA cycle (GO:0006099). For consistency, consider adding this to all activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence for causal relationships**: While the causal relationships between sequential enzyme activities use RO:0002413 (\"provides input for\"), many lack evidence annotations. Consider adding evidence for these connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Regulatory mechanism details**: The regulatory relationship between Sirt3 and the succinate dehydrogenase complex uses RO:0002629 (\"directly positively regulates\") with appropriate evidence, but the mechanism could be elaborated further. Does Sirt3 deacetylate a specific subunit of the complex?\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "- Using appropriate molecular function terms\n",
      "- Correctly representing protein complexes with their components\n",
      "- Using proper causal relationships between activities\n",
      "- Including evidence codes and literature references\n",
      "- Specifying inputs and outputs for reactions\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that effectively represents the mouse TCA cycle. It correctly represents the enzymatic activities, their physical connectivity through metabolites, and includes regulatory components. The minor suggestions above would further enhance the completeness and connectivity of the model, but overall, the model meets GO-CAM standards and accurately represents the biology of the TCA cycle.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Model Overview:\n",
      "This model represents the pyruvate catabolic process in mouse, focusing on lactate dehydrogenase activities and lactate transport. The model includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Pyruvate kinase activity (Pkm) that provides input for lactate dehydrogenase activity\n",
      "2. Three lactate dehydrogenase activities (Ldha, Ldhb, Ldhc) that convert pyruvate to lactate in the cytosol\n",
      "3. Two lactate transmembrane transporters (Slc16a1/MCT1 and Slc16a3/MCT4) that export lactate from the cell\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correct biological pathway representation**: The model accurately represents the canonical glycolytic endpoint where pyruvate is converted to lactate and then exported from the cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate use of causal relationships**: The model uses the \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) relationship appropriately to connect the pyruvate kinase activity to lactate dehydrogenase activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct GO term usage**: The model uses the appropriate molecular function terms for each protein (pyruvate kinase activity, L-lactate dehydrogenase activity, lactate transmembrane transporter activity).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper cellular localization**: The model correctly specifies the subcellular locations for the activities (cytosol for LDH activities, plasma membrane for transporters).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Good evidence support**: The model includes appropriate evidence codes and PMID references for most annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incomplete part_of annotations**: The Ldhb activity (gomodel:633b013300001238/633b013300001437) lacks evidence for its involvement in the pyruvate catabolic process. An evidence code and reference should be added to support this annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing biological context**: The model doesn't clearly indicate the physiological context in which this pathway operates. It would benefit from annotations showing when this pathway is activated (e.g., during anaerobic conditions, high glycolytic flux, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing final destination**: The model shows lactate being transported across the plasma membrane but doesn't indicate where it goes after export. Adding information about lactate's fate in the extracellular space or bloodstream would improve the model's completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing regulation**: The model lacks regulatory components that control lactate dehydrogenase and transporter activities. For example, pH, NAD+/NADH ratio, and oxygen levels are important regulators of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Missing connection to downstream metabolism**: While the model properly represents lactate export, it doesn't show potential reuptake and utilization of lactate by other cells (the lactate shuttle concept), which would provide a more complete biological picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Compliance Issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, the LDH activities would be better represented if their functional relationship as potential tetramers was indicated. LDH typically functions as a tetramer composed of different combinations of LDHA, LDHB, and LDHC subunits.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal chain completeness**: While the pyruvate kinase is shown to provide input for LDHC, there should be a direct causal relationship to the other LDH activities (LDHA, LDHB) as well, especially since all these LDH activities are part of the same process.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggested Improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add evidence for Ldhb's involvement in the pyruvate catabolic process\n",
      "2. Add regulatory relationships that control the lactate dehydrogenase activities\n",
      "3. Expand the model to include the fate of exported lactate\n",
      "4. Consider representing the LDH enzymes' relationship as part of functional tetramers\n",
      "5. Add direct causal relationships between the pyruvate kinase activity and all LDH activities\n",
      "6. Include information about NAD+/NADH involvement in the LDH reaction\n",
      "\n",
      "This model provides a good foundation for representing the pyruvate to lactate conversion pathway in mouse, but could be enhanced with the suggested improvements to provide a more complete biological representation of this important metabolic process.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Biological Content\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pathway Coverage\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the following key aspects of pyruvate catabolism:\n",
      "1. Transport of pyruvate from the cytosol to mitochondrial matrix\n",
      "2. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity and its components\n",

      "\n",
      "### Molecular Components and Activities\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes several important proteins/complexes:\n",
      "- **Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1)** - Facilitates transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane\n",
      "- **Mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPC1, MPC2)** - Transport pyruvate across the inner mitochondrial membrane\n",

      "  - **DLAT** - Acetyltransferase activity\n",
      "  - **DLD** - Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity\n",
      "  - **PDHX** - Molecular adaptor activity within the complex\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive component representation**: The model includes both transport mechanisms (VDAC1, MPC1, MPC2) and enzymatic activities (PDH complex components).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper use of protein complexes**: The model appropriately represents the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (GO:0045254) with its constituent proteins and their specific activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular localization**: Components are properly annotated with their cellular locations (mitochondrial outer membrane, inner membrane, or matrix).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence support**: Annotations have appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Proper use of molecular adaptor activity**: PDHX is correctly annotated with molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090), consistent with its biological role of binding dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) to dihydrolipoamide transacetylase (E2) within the PDH complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redundant activities**: There is some redundancy in the model. For example:\n",
      "   - Activities 633b013300001558 and 633b013300001625 both represent the same pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (GO:0045254) with the same components and molecular function (GO:0034604).\n",
      "   - Activities 633b013300001638 and 633b013300001646 both represent DLAT with the same acetyltransferase activity.\n",
      "   - Activities 633b013300001636 and 633b013300001648 both represent DLD with dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Inconsistent causal associations**: Some causal associations lack evidence annotations while others include them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Some causal flow clarity issues**: The model would benefit from clearer representation of the exact sequence of events in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Redundant molecular adaptor activity**: PDHX is annotated twice with molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) in activities 66c7d41500001378 and 66c7d41500001379, which appear to be duplicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consolidate redundant activities**: Merge duplicate representations of the same protein or complex activities to make the model more concise and easier to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add evidence to all causal associations**: Ensure all causal associations have appropriate evidence annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Refine causal flow**: Clarify the exact sequence of events in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity, making sure the \"provides input for\" and \"part of\" relationships accurately reflect the biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Check complex membership annotations**: Ensure the complex membership is consistent throughout the model and matches current knowledge about the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in mice.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Review recent literature**: The paper \"Rewiring of the Human Mitochondrial Interactome during Neuronal Reprogramming Reveals Regulators of the Respirasome and Neurogenesis\" (PMID:31536960) mentions phosphorylation of PDHA2 on S291/S293 residues and its role in regulation. Consider incorporating this regulatory mechanism into the model if it applies to mouse as well.\n",

      "Overall, this GO-CAM model provides a good representation of pyruvate catabolism in mouse, focusing on the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and associated transport processes. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices in terms of representing protein complexes and molecular activities. However, there are redundant activities that could be consolidated to make the model more streamlined. The causal flow could also be clarified to better represent the sequence of events in this metabolic pathway.\n",

      "### Summary of the Model\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the molecular mechanism by which TRIM27 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) cooperates with STK38L (a serine/threonine-protein kinase) to inhibit ULK1-mediated autophagy. The model depicts four key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TRIM27 (P14373) with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) directly positively regulates STK38L's kinase activity.\n",
      "2. STK38L (Q9Y2H1) with protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) provides input for another TRIM27 ubiquitin ligase activity.\n",
      "3. The second TRIM27 activity directly negatively regulates ULK1.\n",
      "4. ULK1 (O75385) with protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) is involved in positive regulation of autophagy (GO:0010508).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation of Biological Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the findings from the primary literature (PMID:35670107), where TRIM27 acts as a negative regulator of autophagy by:\n",
      "1. Non-degradative ubiquitination of STK38L, which leads to STK38L activation\n",
      "2. Ubiquitination of ULK1, which leads to ULK1 degradation and inhibition of autophagy\n",
      "\n",
      "This regulatory mechanism is biologically significant as it demonstrates how TRIM27 fine-tunes the amplitude and duration of autophagy during starvation conditions. ULK1 is a key initiator of autophagy, and its regulation is crucial for proper cellular response to starvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Assessment of GO-CAM Structure and Adherence to Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Function Annotations**: \n",
      "   - Appropriate use of molecular functions for each protein: TRIM27 (ubiquitin protein ligase activity), STK38L and ULK1 (protein serine/threonine kinase activity)\n",
      "   - All functions are well-supported by evidence from the literature\n",
      "\n",

      "   - The model uses appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) with citations to the primary literature (PMID:35670107)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Specific Improvements Needed\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Small Molecules/Inputs**:\n",
      "   - The model does not explicitly show the ubiquitin molecules as inputs in the TRIM27 ubiquitin ligase activity. According to the E3 ubiquitin ligase guidelines, substrates should be represented as inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete Representation of Ubiquitination Types**:\n",
      "   - Based on the literature (PMID:35670107), TRIM27 catalyzes non-degradative K6- and K11-linked ubiquitination of STK38L, but the specific type of ubiquitination is not indicated in the model.\n",
      "   - The specific ubiquitination sites on ULK1 (reported to be K568 and K571 in the literature) are not represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Condition Context**:\n",
      "   - The model doesn't clearly indicate that this mechanism is specifically activated during starvation-induced autophagy, which is an important contextual detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Incomplete Regulatory Mechanism**:\n",
      "   - The model doesn't show that STK38L phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser495, which primes ULK1 for ubiquitination by TRIM27. This phosphorylation event is a key part of the regulatory mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add ubiquitin molecules as inputs to the TRIM27 ubiquitin ligase activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Specify the types of ubiquitination:\n",
      "   - For STK38L: Use a more specific biological process term to indicate K6- and K11-linked non-degradative ubiquitination\n",
      "   - For ULK1: Indicate that the ubiquitination leads to degradation\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Add the phosphorylation connection from STK38L to ULK1, showing that STK38L directly phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser495.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Add a note or annotation to clarify that this regulatory mechanism is specifically active during starvation-induced autophagy.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Consider extending the model to show downstream effects on autophagosome formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:633b013300001722 provides a good representation of TRIM27's role in regulating autophagy through STK38L and ULK1. The core molecular interactions and causal relationships are accurately captured, and the model is consistent with the primary literature. However, the model would benefit from additional detail regarding the specific types of ubiquitination, the key phosphorylation event, and the starvation context. With these improvements, the model would provide a more complete and precise representation of this important regulatory mechanism.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:6348a65d00000093](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6348a65d00000093)) represents a regulatory pathway involving USP20 (Ubiquitin-specific protease 20), ARRB2 (β-arrestin-2), and TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) in the context of NF-kappa-B signaling in humans. The model shows how USP20 inhibits NF-kappa-B signaling by deubiquitinating TRAF6.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the mechanism described in the literature (PMID:26839314), where:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. USP20 (Q9Y2K6) has cysteine-type deubiquitinase activity (GO:0004843)\n",
      "2. USP20 acts on ARRB2 (P32121), which functions as a molecular adaptor (GO:0060090)\n",
      "3. USP20 negatively regulates TRAF6 (Q9Y4K3), which has ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "4. The ultimate outcome is negative regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0043124)\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological content is consistent with known protein functions in UniProt:\n",
      "- USP20 is known to attenuate TLR4-mediated NF-kappa-B signaling by cooperating with β-arrestin-2/ARRB2 and inhibiting TRAF6 autoubiquitination\n",
      "- ARRB2 functions as a molecular adaptor and is involved in negative regulation of NF-kappa-B signaling\n",
      "- TRAF6 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the synthesis of 'Lys-63'-linked-polyubiquitin chains important for NF-kappa-B activation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Causal Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow of the model follows a logical pattern:\n",
      "1. ARRB2 functions as a molecular adaptor that positively regulates USP20's deubiquitinase activity\n",
      "2. USP20's deubiquitinase activity directly negatively regulates TRAF6's ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "3. The inhibition of TRAF6 leads to the negative regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships use appropriate predicates:\n",
      "- RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for ARRB2's effect on USP20\n",
      "- RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for USP20's effect on TRAF6\n",
      "\n",
      "## Cellular Localization\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly indicates that all activities occur in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737), which is consistent with the UniProt information for these proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes and references:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) with PMID:26839314 for most functional assertions\n",
      "- ECO:0000305 (curator inference used in manual assertion) for cellular locations\n",
      "\n",
      "## Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "1. Activities are connected via causal relationships\n",

      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, there are a few aspects that could be enhanced:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redundant Representation**: There appears to be some redundancy in the model. Activity \"gomodel:6348a65d00000093/6348a65d00000094\" (USP20 deubiquitinase activity) and activity \"gomodel:6348a65d00000093/6348a65d00000115\" (also USP20 deubiquitinase activity) seem to represent the same function enabled by the same protein. This could be consolidated for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Detailed Molecular Mechanism**: The model could be enhanced by including information about the precise ubiquitination sites on TRAF6 that are targeted by USP20, especially since the UniProt entry indicates that TRAF6 is polyubiquitinated on Lys-124.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Connection to Wider Signaling Context**: The model could be expanded to show how this regulatory mechanism connects to upstream TLR4 signaling and downstream NF-kappa-B activation events.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence Base**: One causal association (between ARRB2 and USP20) has two instances of the same evidence, which is redundant. Additionally, there's a causal association with no evidence specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary and Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model successfully represents a regulatory mechanism where USP20 inhibits NF-kappa-B signaling by deubiquitinating TRAF6, with ARRB2 serving as a molecular adaptor in this process. The model is biologically accurate, well-structured, and adheres to GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively communicates the key regulatory interaction between these proteins and their role in attenuating inflammatory signaling. With minor improvements to address redundancy and expand the molecular detail, this would be an exemplary GO-CAM representation of this regulatory pathway.\n",

      "## Overview of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model titled \"Cytotoxic T cell pyroptosis mediated by GSDMB isoform 1 in response to infection by Gram-negative bacteria and its inhibition by S.flexneri IpaH7.8 (Human and S.flexneri)\" represents the pathway where:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Perforin (PRF1) creates pores in the plasma membrane\n",
      "2. Granzyme A (GZMA) enters the cell through these pores\n",
      "3. GZMA cleaves Gasdermin B (GSDMB) to activate its pore-forming function\n",
      "4. GSDMB forms membrane pores that trigger pyroptosis\n",
      "5. S. flexneri IpaH7.8 targets GSDMB for ubiquitination and degradation to prevent pyroptosis\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular activities**: Each protein has been assigned appropriate molecular functions:\n",
      "   - PRF1 with wide pore channel activity (GO:0022829)\n",
      "   - GZMA with serine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004252)\n",
      "   - GSDMB with cardiolipin binding (GO:1901612) and wide pore channel activity (GO:0022829)\n",
      "   - IpaH7.8 with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The model correctly uses:\n",
      "   - RO:0002304 (causally upstream of, positive effect) for PRF1's effect on GZMA\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for GZMA's effect on GSDMB\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for GSDMB's effect on its own pore-forming activity\n",
      "   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for IpaH7.8's effect on GSDMB\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct subcellular locations**:\n",
      "   - PRF1 at plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - GZMA in cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - IpaH7.8 in host cell cytoplasm (GO:0030430)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Well-supported with evidence**: All assertions are backed by appropriate evidence codes and PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing cellular component for GSDMB pore-forming activity**: The model doesn't specify where GSDMB's pore-forming activity occurs. According to the literature (PMID:34022140), GSDMB isoform 1 specifically targets bacterial membranes through cardiolipin binding. This should be specified in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete representation of mechanism**: The model doesn't capture that GSDMB cleaved by GZMA specifically targets bacterial membranes rather than host cell membranes. This is an important distinction for GSDMB isoform 1 as shown in PMID:34022140.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing biological process annotation**: GSDMB's activities could be more specifically annotated as part of \"defense response to Gram-negative bacterium\" (GO:0050829) since this process is mentioned in the title but not explicitly included in the model annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing protein transport annotation**: The model correctly shows PRF1 creating pores to allow GZMA entry, but doesn't explicitly annotate PRF1's role in \"protein transmembrane transport\" (GO:0071806), though this process is included.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities and their causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The representation of complex activities is consistent with guidelines from \"How_to_annotate_complexes_in_GO-CAM\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The automated changes noted in the comments (replacing RO:0002212 with RO:0002630 and RO:0002213 with RO:0002629) are appropriate updates to the relation ontology terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately captures the finding from Zhou et al. (2020) that GZMA cleaves GSDMB to trigger pyroptosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The model correctly depicts the role of S. flexneri IpaH7.8 in targeting GSDMB for ubiquitination and degradation, as reported in Hansen et al. (PMID:34022140).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The representation of PRF1's role in forming membrane pores for GZMA delivery is consistent with the established mechanism described in Thiery et al. (PMID:20038786).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The specific targeting of bacterial membranes by GSDMB isoform 1 (as opposed to other isoforms that might target host cell membranes) could be more explicitly captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add cellular component annotation for GSDMB pore-forming activity**: Specify that GSDMB's pore-forming activity targets bacterial membranes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add more specific biological process annotation**: Include \"defense response to Gram-negative bacterium\" (GO:0050829) for GSDMB activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clarify isoform specificity**: The model title mentions GSDMB isoform 1, but it would be helpful to note in the annotations that this isoform specifically targets bacterial membranes rather than host cell membranes.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This model describes the regulatory pathway involving IL-22 and Reg3g in allergic airway inflammation in mice, based primarily on findings from Ito et al. (2017) published in PMID:28811323. The model illustrates how IL-22, produced mainly by CD4+ T cells, induces Reg3g (Regenerating islet-derived protein 3-gamma) expression from lung epithelial cells through STAT3 activation, which then suppresses allergic airway inflammation by inhibiting epithelial cytokine production.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes these key biological entities:\n",
      "- IL-22 (MGI:MGI:1355307) with cytokine activity\n",
      "- IL-22 receptor complex (IL22ra1, MGI:MGI:2663588)\n",
      "- STAT3 (MGI:MGI:103038) as a transcription factor\n",
      "- Reg3g (MGI:MGI:109406) as an effector molecule\n",
      "- EXTL3 (MGI:MGI:1860765) as a receptor for Reg3g\n",
      "- Downstream inflammatory cytokines including IL-33 (MGI:MGI:1924375) and TSLP (MGI:MGI:1855696)\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow shows IL-22 signaling through IL-22Ra1, activating STAT3, which induces Reg3g expression. Reg3g then acts on EXTL3 to negatively regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Well-supported by evidence**: Each activity and causal relationship is backed by experimental data from peer-reviewed literature (primarily PMID:28811323).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal predicates such as \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) and \"causally upstream of, negative effect\" (RO:0002305).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clear biological pathway representation**: The model clearly represents how IL-22 signaling leads to reduced allergic inflammation via Reg3g.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cell and subcellular locations**: Activities are properly annotated with their cellular contexts, such as extracellular space (GO:0005615) for cytokines and nucleus (GO:0005634) for STAT3.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: The IL-22 receptor complex should be more explicitly represented according to GO-CAM best practices. Currently, only IL22ra1 is shown, while the complex likely involves additional components. According to the \"How_to_annotate_complexes_in_GO-CAM\" guidelines, if the specific activity-bearing subunit is known, that's appropriate, but it might be worth noting the other components.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cell-type annotations**: While some activities have cell type annotations, they could be more consistently applied. For example, IL-22 is known to be produced by CD4+ T cells (mentioned in the paper), but this cell type association isn't explicitly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback mechanisms**: The paper describes some feedback mechanisms and complex interactions between different cell types that could be more fully represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular details of STAT3 activation**: The phosphorylation of STAT3 and its translocation to the nucleus are critical steps in the pathway but aren't explicitly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures the key findings from the primary literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The paper shows that IL-22 is produced mainly by CD4+ T cells that don't produce IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-13, or IL-17A.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. IL-22 receptor (IL-22R1) is expressed in lung epithelial cells but not immune cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. IL-22 induces Reg3gamma production from lung epithelial cells through STAT3 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Neutralization of Reg3gamma exacerbates HDM-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. EXTL3 serves as a functional receptor for Reg3gamma in lung epithelial cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Reg3gamma administration suppresses HDM-induced TSLP and IL-33 expression and reduces ILC2 accumulation in the lung.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommended Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add molecular details of STAT3 activation**: Include annotations indicating phosphorylation of STAT3 and its translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expand receptor complex representation**: Consider adding other components of the IL-22 receptor complex if they're known.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add cell type annotations**: Consistently annotate cell types across all relevant activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Include ILC2 cells**: The paper discusses type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and their role in the inflammatory process, which could be included in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider adding the house dust mite (HDM) allergen**: Since the experimental system used HDM to induce allergic inflammation, it might be beneficial to represent this trigger in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model effectively captures the key regulatory pathway by which IL-22 induces Reg3g to suppress allergic airway inflammation in mice. It is well-supported by literature evidence and uses appropriate causal relationships. With a few improvements to represent complex components more explicitly and to add more cellular context, this would be an excellent model for understanding the IL-22-Reg3g axis in allergic inflammation.\n",

      "## Overview of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents a pathway involved in the regulation of allergic airway inflammation in humans. It shows how IL-22 and REG3A proteins function to suppress allergic airway inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine production. The model is based primarily on a publication by Ito et al. (2017), which demonstrated that IL-22 induces REG3A (referred to as REG3γ in mice) expression from lung epithelial cells through STAT3 activation to suppress house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows the following signaling cascade:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. IL22 (UniProtKB:Q9GZX6) has cytokine activity (GO:0005125) in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "2. IL22 directly positively regulates IL22RA1 (UniProtKB:Q8N6P7) which has interleukin-22 receptor activity (GO:0042018) \n",
      "3. IL22RA1 provides input for STAT3 (UniProtKB:P40763) which has DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0000981)\n",
      "4. STAT3 provides input for REG3A (UniProtKB:Q06141) which has hormone activity (GO:0005179)\n",
      "5. REG3A directly positively regulates EXTL3 (UniProtKB:O43909) which has protein-hormone receptor activity (GO:0016500)\n",
      "6. EXTL3 causally upstream of (negative effect) IL33 (UniProtKB:O95760) and TSLP (UniProtKB:Q969D9), both of which have cytokine activity (GO:0005125)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. The model captures the main findings from the Ito et al. paper showing how IL-22 induces REG3A to suppress allergic airway inflammation.\n",
      "2. The causal relationships between the entities are properly represented.\n",
      "3. The model correctly places the proteins in their cellular locations (extracellular space, plasma membrane, nucleus, etc.)\n",
      "4. The model illustrates the negative regulatory effect of this pathway on inflammatory cytokine production (IL33 and TSLP).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Function Assignment for REG3A**: \n",
      "   - REG3A is annotated with \"hormone activity\" (GO:0005179), but according to UniProt and literature, it should be annotated with \"cytokine activity\" (GO:0005125). The paper and UniProt both characterize it as acting like a cytokine that regulates tissue responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological Process Context**:\n",
      "   - REG3A is part of \"negative regulation of inflammatory response\" (GO:0050728), which is appropriate, but it could be more specific, such as \"negative regulation of cytokine production involved in inflammatory response\" (GO:1900016) which is already used for EXTL3 in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Mechanistic Detail**:\n",
      "   - The model does not capture the detail that STAT3 activation in epithelial cells is dependent on IL-22 binding to its receptor (IL-22R1). The paper mentions STAT3 is activated in a pathway-specific manner.\n",
      "   - The mechanism by which EXTL3 inhibits IL33 and TSLP production isn't clearly represented (the paper indicates it likely involves PI3K-AKT signaling pathway).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Receptor Ligand Modeling**:\n",
      "   - According to the GO-CAM signaling receptor activity guidelines, the relation between a ligand and its target receptor should be \"has input\" rather than \"directly positively regulates\".\n",
      "   - The receptor (IL22RA1) should have its input as the effector protein it regulates (STAT3 in this case), which is correctly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence Codes and References**:\n",
      "   - While many of the activities are supported by evidence from the primary publication (PMID:28811323), some parts of the model rely on sequence similarity evidence (ECO:0000250) rather than direct experimental evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Change the molecular function of REG3A from \"hormone activity\" to \"cytokine activity\" to better reflect its biological role.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider adding the PI3K-AKT-STAT3 pathway components that mediate the effect of REG3A-EXTL3 on inflammatory cytokine production, which would make the mechanism clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Consider changing the relation between IL22 and IL22RA1 from \"directly positively regulates\" to \"has input\" to better follow GO-CAM signaling receptor activity guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Add more specific biological process annotations where applicable, particularly for REG3A's role in inhibiting cytokine production.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Consider adding more direct experimental evidence where available, rather than relying on sequence similarity evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model effectively captures the regulatory pathway by which IL-22 and REG3A suppress allergic airway inflammation through inhibiting inflammatory cytokine production. The model is consistent with the findings reported in the literature and follows most GO-CAM best practices.

The model is based primarily on research published in PMID:35263589, where Reg3g is shown to penetrate the brain during endotoxemia and suppress the expression of microglial indoleamine dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a critical enzyme in the kynurenine pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Structure Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Components and Pathway Flow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initiating ligand**: Reg3g (MGI:MGI:109406) with hormone activity (GO:0005179) in extracellular space\n",

      "3. **Signaling cascade**: Involves multiple components including:\n",
      "   - Xiap (MGI:MGI:107572) - signaling adaptor activity\n",
      "   - Bcl10 (MGI:MGI:1337994) - signaling adaptor activity\n",
      "   - Rac1 (MGI:MGI:97845) - G protein activity\n",
      "   - E2f1 (MGI:MGI:101941) - DNA-binding transcription activator activity\n",
      "   - Bin1 (MGI:MGI:108092) - signaling adaptor activity\n",
      "4. **Kynurenine pathway enzymes**:\n",
      "   - Ido1 (MGI:MGI:96416) - indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity\n",
      "   - Kmo (MGI:MGI:2138151) - kynurenine 3-monooxygenase activity\n",
      "   - Kynu (MGI:MGI:1918039) - kynureninase activity\n",

      "5. **Metabolic components**:\n",
      "   - Src (MGI:MGI:98397) - protein tyrosine kinase activity\n",
      "   - Hk1 (MGI:MGI:96103) - glucokinase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Positive Aspects of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model appears to represent a biologically plausible pathway based on the published literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular context**: Appropriate cellular locations are included for many activities (e.g., Reg3g in extracellular space, Extl3 in plasma membrane).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relations**: The model uses appropriate causal relations between entities (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\" and RO:0002304/RO:0002305 for upstream causal effects).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence**: All activities have evidence codes and references to literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Metabolic pathway representation**: The kynurenine pathway is accurately represented with proper inputs and outputs of the enzymatic reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing cellular locations**: Several activities have GO:0005575 (cellular_component) as their location, which is a generic term. Specific cellular locations should be provided where possible.\n",
      "   - For example, Ido1, Kmo, and Kynu should have more specific cellular locations based on literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete information flow**: While the general pathway is represented, the exact information flow between some components could be clarified:\n",
      "   - The connection between Reg3g's hormone activity and the kynurenine pathway inhibition could be more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing complexes**: If any of these activities involve protein complexes, they should be properly represented according to the complex annotation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Regulation clarity**: The inhibitory effect of Reg3g on the kynurenine pathway could be more explicitly modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Biological process context**: While most activities are annotated as part of \"response to lipopolysaccharide\" (GO:0032496), some metabolic enzymes might benefit from more specific process annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Specific Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improve cellular locations**:\n",
      "   - Specify the cellular locations for activities currently annotated with GO:0005575.\n",
      "   - Verify the cellular locations of kynurenine pathway enzymes based on literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify causal relations**:\n",
      "   - Ensure the causal relationships between signaling components are biologically accurate.\n",
      "   - The regulatory effects between E2f1 and Bin1 could be clarified based on literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enhance molecular details**:\n",
      "   - If specific small molecules like lipopolysaccharide play regulatory roles, ensure they are properly represented.\n",
      "   - Verify that all inputs/outputs for enzymatic reactions are correctly captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Expand biological context**:\n",
      "   - Consider adding more specific biological process annotations for some activities.\n",
      "   - Clarify how this pathway connects to endotoxic death prevention.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "GO-CAM model gomodel:6348a65d00001191 is a well-constructed representation of how nociceptor-derived Reg3g affects the kynurenine pathway in microglia during endotoxemia.

      "5. The model is evidence-based, with appropriate PMID references and evidence codes for all assertions\n",
      "6. The model provides a clear mechanistic understanding of how REG3A inhibits inflammatory responses\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signaling receptor annotation**: The model correctly implements the signaling receptor guidelines for EXTL3 (O43909), showing it as a receptor for REG3A hormone activity. The causal relation between REG3A and EXTL3 is appropriately annotated as \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Transcription factor annotation**: STAT3 is correctly annotated with DNA-binding transcription factor activity and shown to occur in the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Activity flow**: The causal connections between activities follow the appropriate patterns for regulation, with direct relationships where activities directly influence each other and appropriate input relationships where needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence annotation**: Each activity and causal edge has appropriate evidence codes and PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pathway Context Expansion**: The model could be enhanced by including additional context about IL-33 production, particularly how hyperglycemia inhibits IL-17-induced IL-33 production, which is a key mechanism described in the paper for how diabetes impairs this regulatory pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Further Molecular Detail**: The model correctly shows that REG3A regulates EXTL3, but could potentially add more detail about the EXTL3-PI3K-AKT-STAT3 signaling pathway mentioned in the paper. Currently, the model directly connects EXTL3 to STAT3 activity without showing the intervening AKT activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complex Representation**: Based on the complex annotation guidelines, if there are any protein complexes involved in this pathway (potentially in the signaling or transcription activities), they could be more explicitly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Accuracy of Biological Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological content is highly accurate and consistent with the primary literature (PMID:27830702). The model captures the main finding that REG3A regulates TLR3-mediated inflammation through SHP-1 and JNK2, and that this pathway is disrupted in diabetes due to decreased REG3A expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships align with the experimental evidence provided in the paper, including the demonstration that:\n",
      "- REG3A induces SHP-1 expression via EXTL3-PI3K-AKT-STAT3 signaling\n",
      "- SHP-1 inhibits TLR3-activated JNK2 phosphorylation\n",
      "- SHP-1 inhibition increases TNF-alpha and IL-6 production\n",
      "- JNK2, not JNK1, is the key mediator of TLR3-induced inflammation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides an accurate and well-structured representation of how REG3A negatively regulates inflammatory responses to wounding via the EXTL3-STAT3-SHP1-JNK2 pathway. The model correctly implements GO-CAM curation best practices and provides a clear mechanistic understanding of the biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model would be enhanced by providing more detail about the PI3K-AKT intermediate signaling steps and by expanding the context to show how this pathway is dysregulated in diabetes through decreased IL-33 production. However, these are minor suggestions and do not detract from the overall high quality of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend the model for approval as it provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of wound healing regulation and inflammation in the context of diabetes.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model ([gomodel:6348a65d00002174](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6348a65d00002174)) describes the process by which USP44 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 44) deubiquitinates the transcription factor FOXP3, which stabilizes FOXP3 protein levels and promotes regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. The model includes three main activities connected in a causal pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TGF-β1 cytokine activity\n",
      "2. USP44 deubiquitinase activity\n",
      "3. FOXP3 DNA-binding transcription factor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scientific Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the scientific literature. The primary reference (PMID:32644293) provides strong evidence for USP44 as a deubiquitinase that targets FOXP3, removing K48-linked ubiquitin modifications which would otherwise lead to FOXP3 degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key scientific points supported by evidence:\n",
      "- USP44 stabilizes FOXP3 by removing K48-linked ubiquitin chains\n",
      "- TGF-β1 induces USP44 expression during iTreg differentiation\n",
      "- USP44 maintains FOXP3 stability and enhances Treg function\n",
      "- This process occurs in the nucleus\n",
      "\n",
      "### Structure and Connectivity Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows a proper causal flow with appropriate relationship predicates:\n",
      "1. TGF-β1 (P01137) cytokine activity occurs in extracellular space and is part of the TGF-β receptor signaling pathway\n",
      "2. TGF-β1 has two causal connections to USP44 using both:\n",
      "   - RO:0002304 (causally upstream of, positive effect)\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates)\n",
      "3. USP44 (Q9H0E7) deubiquitinase activity occurs in the nucleus and is part of regulatory T cell differentiation\n",
      "4. USP44 causally regulates FOXP3 via RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates)\n",
      "5. FOXP3 (Q9BZS1) DNA-binding transcription factor activity occurs in the nucleus and is part of regulatory T cell differentiation\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular activities**: Each protein is assigned an appropriate molecular function. USP44 is correctly annotated with deubiquitinase activity (GO:0101005) rather than the more generic term.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relations**: The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates. The use of both RO:0002304 and RO:0002629 for TGF-β1's effect on USP44 is consistent with evidence showing that TGF-β1 both directly and indirectly regulates USP44.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular locations**: All activities are correctly annotated with their cellular locations - TGF-β1 in extracellular space, and both USP44 and FOXP3 in the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Part-of relations**: Each activity is appropriately linked to the biological processes they participate in.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence codes**: The model consistently uses ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) supported by PMID:32644293, which is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: While the model accurately represents the main activities, it does not explicitly represent the K48-linked ubiquitin chains that are removed from FOXP3. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, since USP44 is the subunit that carries the deubiquitinase activity, the current representation is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional biological context**: The model could potentially be expanded to include:\n",
      "   - The E3 ubiquitin ligase (STUB1) that adds ubiquitin to FOXP3 (mentioned in the paper)\n",
      "   - The cooperation between USP44 and USP7 in deubiquitinating FOXP3 (mentioned in the paper)\n",
      "   - Downstream effects of stabilized FOXP3 on Treg suppressive function\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Details of activation mechanism**: The model doesn't represent how TGF-β signaling specifically induces USP44 expression via SMAD2/3 binding to the USP44 promoter (as shown in the paper).\n",

      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:6348a65d00002174) is scientifically accurate and follows GO-CAM best practices.

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model (gomodel:6348a65d00002236) represents the regulation of anaphase initiation through USP44-mediated deubiquitination of CDC20 in human cells. The model captures the interactions between four key proteins:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **USP44** (UniProtKB:Q9H0E7) - A deubiquitinating enzyme\n",
      "2. **CDC20** (UniProtKB:Q12834) - A cell division cycle protein and APC/C co-activator\n",
      "3. **UBE2C** (UniProtKB:O00762) - A ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme \n",
      "4. **ANAPC11** (UniProtKB:Q9NYG5) - An anaphase-promoting complex subunit\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context\n",
      "\n",
      "This model captures the molecular mechanisms of the spindle assembly checkpoint, which ensures proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. UBE2C has ubiquitin conjugating enzyme activity that positively regulates CDC20's function\n",
      "2. USP44 has deubiquitinase activity that negatively regulates CDC20's function\n",
      "3. CDC20 has APC-binding activity which positively affects ANAPC11's function\n",
      "4. ANAPC11 has ubiquitin-protein transferase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, these activities represent a regulatory circuit of ubiquitination and deubiquitination that controls the metaphase-to-anaphase transition in mitosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate Biological Representation**: The model accurately captures the key proteins involved in anaphase initiation control through CDC20 regulation, supported by the PMID:17443180 (Stegmeier et al.) which shows that USP44 deubiquitinates CDC20.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Causal Relations**: The model correctly uses RO:0002304 (causally upstream of, positive effect) and RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) to represent the relationships between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clear Cellular Localization**: All activities are appropriately annotated with cellular compartments (GO:0005680 for anaphase-promoting complex, GO:0072686 for mitotic spindle).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper Evidence Codes**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes like ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) with corresponding PMID references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redundant Causal Association**: There appear to be two identical causal associations from USP44's deubiquitinase activity to CDC20's activity, both using the same predicate (RO:0002630). One of these lacks evidence while the other cites PMID:17443180. The redundant association without evidence should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Evidence for One Connection**: The causal association between CDC20's APC binding activity (gomodel:6348a65d00002236/6348a65d00002247) and ANAPC11's ubiquitin-protein transferase activity lacks evidence (empty evidence array).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Could Benefit from Additional Context**: While the model accurately captures the core regulatory mechanism, it could be enhanced by including additional proteins involved in this pathway, such as MAD2L1, which is known to form a complex with CDC20 as described in the referenced paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **No Transport or Input Activities**: The model doesn't include any chemical entities or transport activities that could provide additional contextual information about the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is biologically accurate and supported by the literature. The Stegmeier et al. paper (PMID:17443180) clearly demonstrates:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. USP44 is a deubiquitinating enzyme critical for spindle checkpoint function\n",
      "2. USP44 prevents premature activation of APC/C by deubiquitinating CDC20 \n",
      "3. USP44 helps stabilize the inhibitory MAD2-CDC20 complex\n",
      "4. There's a dynamic balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination in regulating anaphase entry\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model accurately represents these findings, though it doesn't capture the full complexity of the MAD2-CDC20 interaction described in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "Reviewing against GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Annotation**: The model follows best practices by representing individual protein activities rather than annotating to complexes (as per \"How_to_annotate_complexes_in_GO-CAM\").\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regulation Representation**: The model correctly represents regulation by using appropriate causal relationships between activities, following the guidelines in \"Regulation and Regulatory Processes in GO-CAM\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Part_of Relations**: Each molecular function is appropriately annotated as part_of a biological process (GO:0045841 and GO:0045842).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Context**: All activities include occurs_in annotations to provide cellular context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove Redundant Causal Association**: Delete the USP44's negative regulation of CDC20 that lacks evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Evidence for Missing Connection**: Add evidence for the causal association between CDC20 and ANAPC11.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider Expanding the Model**: Include MAD2L1 and its interaction with CDC20 to better represent the full regulatory mechanism described in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Chemical Entity**: Consider adding ubiquitin as a chemical entity to provide more context to the ubiquitination/deubiquitination processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Clarify UBE2C's Role**: The evidence for UBE2C's role (PMID:12629039) could not be accessed, so verifying this relationship with alternative evidence might be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the key molecular mechanisms involved in USP44-mediated regulation of anaphase initiation through CDC20 deubiquitination. With a few minor improvements, it would be an excellent representation of this biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows most GO-CAM best practices and is supported by high-quality experimental evidence from the literature. The main suggestion for improvement is to remove redundant relationships and potentially expand the model to include additional relevant proteins like MAD2L1 for a more comprehensive representation of the regulatory network.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model titled \"Negative regulation of white adipogenesis by OVOL2. (Human)\" represents a biological pathway where OVOL2 (Ovo-like zinc finger 2) negatively regulates white adipogenesis. The model is based on human data and has a \"production\" status.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four main activities:\n",
      "1. **OVOL2 (Q9BRP0)** - Transcription corepressor activity (GO:0003714)\n",
      "2. **CEBPA (P49715)** - DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific (GO:0001228)\n",
      "3. **SLC2A4/GLUT4 (P14672)** - D-glucose transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0055056)\n",
      "4. **FABP4 (P15090)** - Long-chain fatty acid transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0005324)\n",
      "\n",
      "The model describes how OVOL2 negatively regulates CEBPA, which in turn positively regulates both SLC2A4 and FABP4, leading to white fat cell proliferation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains three causal associations:\n",
      "1. OVOL2 directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) CEBPA\n",
      "2. CEBPA provides input for (RO:0002407) SLC2A4\n",
      "3. CEBPA provides input for (RO:0002407) FABP4\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is supported by appropriate evidence, primarily from PMID:36228616, which describes OVOL2's role in suppressing white adipogenesis by blocking CEBPA binding to its transcriptional targets. The model also references PMID:12556481 and PMID:12077340 as supporting evidence for specific relationships.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly represents OVOL2's role in inhibiting white adipogenesis as described in the primary literature (PMID:36228616).\n",
      "2. **Proper protein-protein interaction representation**: The interaction between OVOL2 and CEBPA is correctly modeled, with OVOL2 directly inhibiting CEBPA's transcriptional activity.\n",
      "3. **Appropriate downstream targets**: The model correctly identifies FABP4 and GLUT4 as downstream targets of CEBPA in the adipogenesis pathway.\n",
      "4. **Correct causal relationships**: The causal relationships (negative regulation of CEBPA by OVOL2 and positive regulation of FABP4/GLUT4 by CEBPA) align with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Minor evidence issue**: Evidence statements appear to be appropriate, but the annotation linking FABP4 to GO:0005324 (long-chain fatty acid transmembrane transporter activity) cites transfer from mouse ortholog (P04117) via ECO:0000250. While FABP4 does indeed bind and transport fatty acids, suggesting it acts as a fatty acid transporter, the evidence would be stronger with direct experimental evidence in human cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Improvement opportunity**: The model could be enhanced by including additional molecular details about how OVOL2 inhibits CEBPA, such as:\n",
      "   - The physical interaction between OVOL2's zinc finger domains and CEBPA's bZIP domain\n",
      "   - The mechanism by which this interaction prevents CEBPA binding to DNA targets\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Model completeness**: The model could be expanded to include:\n",
      "   - Additional downstream targets of CEBPA in the adipogenesis pathway\n",
      "   - The role of PPARγ, which is mentioned in the literature as an important player in adipogenesis\n",
      "   - The thermogenic function of OVOL2 in brown/beige adipocytes, which is also described in PMID:36228616\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular contextualization**: The model would benefit from including cellular components for all activities, such as specifying that OVOL2 and CEBPA activities occur in the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, gomodel:6348a65d00002600 is a high-quality GO-CAM model that accurately represents the negative regulation of white adipogenesis by OVOL2 through inhibition of CEBPA transcriptional activity. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices for representing protein activities and causal relationships. It is supported by appropriate evidence from the literature, particularly PMID:36228616, which provides detailed molecular insights into OVOL2's dual role in promoting thermogenesis and limiting white adipogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be improved by providing more molecular detail about the OVOL2-CEBPA interaction, expanding the representation of the adipogenesis pathway, and adding cellular context information. However, these are suggestions for enhancement rather than corrections of errors, as the model is fundamentally accurate in its current form.\n",

      "## Review of GO-CAM Model: Ascorbic acid biosynthetic process 1 (Mouse)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:6348a65d00002622) represents the ascorbic acid (vitamin C) biosynthetic pathway in mouse, which consists of a sequence of enzymatic activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. UTP-monosaccharide-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (Ugp2)\n",
      "2. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (Ugdh)\n",
      "3. Alpha-glucuronidase (Ugt1a6a)\n",
      "4. L-glucuronate reductase (Akr1a1)\n",
      "5. Gluconolactonase (Rgn)\n",
      "6. L-gulonolactone oxidase (Gulo)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "1. **Accurate Biological Pathway**: The model correctly represents the known enzymatic steps in mouse ascorbic acid biosynthesis. This pathway is well-established in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct Causal Flow**: The model uses the RO:0002413 \"provides input for\" relation to connect the enzymes in the proper order of the biochemical pathway, showing a clear linear flow from Ugp2 to Gulo, culminating in the production of L-ascorbate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper Evidence Documentation**: Each activity in the model is supported by appropriate evidence codes (ECO terms) and references to scientific literature. The model uses a combination of direct assay (ECO:0000314), mutant phenotype (ECO:0000315), genetic interaction (ECO:0000316), and sequence orthology (ECO:0000266) evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Taxonomic Specificity**: The model is correctly specified as being for mouse (NCBITaxon:10090), which is appropriate since mice, unlike humans, can synthesize ascorbic acid.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement or Verification\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Input/Output Specification**: While L-ascorbate is specified as the output of the Gulo activity, intermediate metabolites between the other enzymatic steps are not explicitly represented as inputs/outputs. Adding these would enhance the clarity of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Part_of Relation Consistency**: All activities are annotated as part_of GO:0009058 (biosynthetic process), which is correct but somewhat general. It would be more specific to annotate them as part_of \"ascorbic acid biosynthetic process\" (GO:0019853).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Subcellular Location**: The model doesn't specify the subcellular locations of these activities. Based on the UniProt data, these enzymes function in different cellular compartments (e.g., cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence Documentation**: Although evidence is present, some activities rely on a single piece of evidence. Additional supporting evidence would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Missing Context**: It would be useful to include information about tissue-specificity (liver is the primary site of ascorbic acid synthesis in mice).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Intermediate Metabolites**: Specify the chemical entities that serve as inputs and outputs for each enzymatic step:\n",
      "   - Beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate → UDP-glucose → UDP-glucuronate → L-gluconate → L-gulonolactone → L-ascorbate\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Refine Part_of Relations**: Consider changing the part_of relationship from the general \"biosynthetic process\" to the more specific \"ascorbic acid biosynthetic process\" (GO:0019853).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add Subcellular Locations**: Add cellular component annotations for each activity, particularly for Gulo which is known to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Context Enrichment**: Consider adding information about the tissue context (liver) where this pathway primarily occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Activity Regulation**: Based on the literature (like PMID:10606751), there's evidence that this pathway is regulated by the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). This regulatory aspect could be incorporated into the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model accurately represents the ascorbic acid biosynthetic pathway in mouse with appropriate causal connections between activities. The model follows GO-CAM best practices in terms of using appropriate evidence codes and references. With the suggested enhancements, the model could provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important biosynthetic pathway.\n",

      "## Improvements and Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally accurate and well-constructed, I have a few suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional Biological Context**: The model could be enriched by connecting this pathway to related biological processes like the pentose phosphate pathway (**GO:0006098**) and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (**GO:0009052**).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regulation Representation**: Consider adding regulatory aspects of these enzymes if relevant information is available from the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Connection to Oxidative Branch**: It might be valuable to represent the connection to the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway in a future version of this model or in a linked model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Input/Output for GPI1**: While the model correctly shows GPI1 providing input to TALDO1, it might be helpful to explicitly show the input glucose-6-phosphate for GPI1 to make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the xylulose-5-phosphate biosynthetic process in mouse through the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. The model appropriately represents the molecular functions, biological process context, and causal relationships between the enzymatic activities involved. The evidence used to support the annotations is appropriate and current.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully captures the metabolic flow from glucose-6-phosphate isomerase through transaldolase and transketolase activities to produce xylulose-5-phosphate, with triose phosphate isomerase playing a supporting role in providing a necessary substrate. This representation is consistent with our current understanding of this metabolic pathway as supported by the cited literature.\n",

      "\n",
      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: The NLRP3 inflammasome (Human)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (ID: [gomodel:635b1e3e00001811](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:635b1e3e00001811)) represents the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in humans, depicting how this crucial innate immune complex assembles and functions to trigger pyroptosis and cytokine secretion. The model shows the activities of several key proteins including NLRP3, CASP1, GSDMD, and the resulting mature cytokines IL1B and IL18.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model effectively captures the key components and activities in the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, from sensor activation to cytokine secretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct use of causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationships (mostly RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\") between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Well-supported evidence**: Each activity and relationship has appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) with supporting literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate molecular functions**: The molecular functions assigned to each protein are appropriate based on their known roles (e.g., NLRP3 with sensing and adaptor activity, GSDMD with channel activity).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Logical flow of activities**: The model shows a clear progression from NLRP3 sensing to inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, gasdermin D cleavage, and finally cytokine release.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cellular component annotations**: While most components have appropriate cellular locations, some refinements could be made:\n",
      "   - NLRP3 (UniProtKB:Q96P20) is shown in multiple locations (GO:0005815 microtubule organizing center, GO:0016020 membrane). While this is consistent with the literature, indicating specific membrane compartments like \"Golgi apparatus membrane\" (based on UniProt data) would be more precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing environmental triggers**: The model doesn't explicitly represent the stimuli that activate NLRP3 (e.g., PAMPs, DAMPs, ATP, nigericin). Including these would provide a more complete picture of inflammasome activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complexes representation**: According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guideline, when the subunit carrying an activity is known, individual proteins should be represented rather than using a complex ID. The model follows this correctly by showing individual components, but it could be useful to explicitly show the complex formation step.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **NEK7 regulation of NLRP3**: The model includes NEK7's molecular function activator activity (GO:0140677) acting on NLRP3, which is accurate according to the literature. However, the mechanism by which NEK7 licenses NLRP3 activation could be more explicitly shown, as it's a critical regulatory step.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **PYCARD/ASC representation**: While NLRP3 and CASP1 are represented, the adaptor protein PYCARD/ASC (which bridges NLRP3 and CASP1) is not explicitly included in the model. Adding PYCARD would make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Upstream signaling events**: The model could include the \"priming\" step of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which involves NF-κB-mediated transcriptional upregulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL1B.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Comments on Activities and Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **NLRP3 activities (UniProtKB:Q96P20)**:\n",
      "   - Correctly shown with multiple molecular functions including molecular sensor activity (GO:0140299), signaling adaptor activity (GO:0035591), and phospholipid binding activities (GO:0070273).\n",
      "   - The model correctly represents the localization to microtubule organizing center and membrane.\n",
      "   - The activities are appropriately connected to show the sequential activation of NLRP3.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **CASP1 activities (UniProtKB:P29466)**:\n",
      "   - Appropriately shown with cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004197).\n",
      "   - The causal relationships showing CASP1 cleaving GSDMD and pro-cytokines are accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **GSDMD activities (UniProtKB:P57764)**:\n",
      "   - Correctly represented with phospholipid binding activities (GO:0070273, GO:0005546) and wide pore channel activity (GO:0022829).\n",
      "   - The progression from binding phospholipids to forming pores that allow cytokine release is well-represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cytokine activities (IL1B and IL18)**:\n",
      "   - Both are appropriately shown with cytokine activity (GO:0005125) in the extracellular space.\n",
      "   - The model correctly shows these as the terminal outputs of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **NEK7 regulation**:\n",
      "   - The molecular function activator activity (GO:0140677) of NEK7 directly regulating NLRP3 is well-supported by recent literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with current understanding of NLRP3 inflammasome biology, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The role of NLRP3 as a sensor for various stimuli\n",
      "2. The requirement for NEK7 as a licensing factor for NLRP3 activation\n",
      "3. The cleavage of GSDMD by CASP1 to form membrane pores\n",
      "4. The maturation and secretion of IL1B and IL18 through these pores\n",
      "\n",
      "The model reflects findings from recent publications (e.g., PMID:35254907, PMID:35114687, PMID:36227980) cited in the evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Enhancement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add PYCARD/ASC**: Include PYCARD (UniProtKB:Q9ULZ3) and its pyrin domain-mediated interactions with NLRP3, which is essential for inflammasome assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Represent oligomerization states**: The model could explicitly show the oligomerization of NLRP3 and PYCARD/ASC, which is crucial for inflammasome function.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include priming step**: Add the LPS/NF-κB-mediated priming events that upregulate NLRP3 and pro-IL1B expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Show post-translational modifications**: Include key PTMs like phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and palmitoylation that regulate NLRP3 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Refine membrane locations**: Specify the exact membrane compartments where NLRP3 and GSDMD operate (e.g., Golgi, plasma membrane).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of NLRP3 inflammasome biology. The model effectively captures the key molecular activities and causal relationships in the pathway. With a few enhancements to include additional components and regulatory events, it could provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important innate immune pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Taxon**: NCBITaxon:9606 (Human)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents how Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein PtpB inhibits gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis in host cells. The molecular mechanism involves PtpB acting as a phospholipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the host cell membrane, thereby disrupting the membrane localization of cleaved GSDMD and inhibiting cytokine release and pyroptosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Activities\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes six molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ubiquitin binding activity of PtpB (I6WXK4)\n",
      "2. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphatase activity of PtpB (I6WXK4)\n",
      "3. Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate phosphatase activity of PtpB (I6WXK4)\n",
      "4. Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate binding activity of human GSDMD (P57764)\n",
      "5. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding activity of human GSDMD (P57764)\n",
      "6. Wide pore channel activity of human GSDMD (P57764)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts the following causal relationships:\n",
      "- PtpB ubiquitin binding activity directly positively regulates its phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphatase activity\n",
      "- PtpB ubiquitin binding activity directly positively regulates its phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate phosphatase activity\n",
      "- PtpB phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphatase activity directly negatively regulates GSDMD phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding\n",
      "- PtpB phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate phosphatase activity directly negatively regulates GSDMD phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate binding\n",
      "- GSDMD phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding directly positively regulates GSDMD wide pore channel activity\n",
      "- GSDMD phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate binding directly positively regulates GSDMD wide pore channel activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities and relationships are supported by experimental evidence, primarily from PMID:36227980, with appropriate ECO codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Review Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate Representation of Mechanism**: The model accurately captures the molecular mechanism described in the literature (PMID:36227980) about how M. tuberculosis PtpB inhibits GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate GO Terms**: The model uses appropriate GO terms for molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Well-supported Evidence**: All activities and causal relationships are properly supported by evidence and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate Causal Logic**: The causal flow from PtpB's phosphatase activity to the inhibition of GSDMD membrane localization and pore formation is logically represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues Identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redundant Causal Association**: There are duplicate causal associations between activities. Specifically, there are two identical causal associations from `gomodel:635b1e3e00002003/635b1e3e00002138` (PtpB ubiquitin binding) to `gomodel:635b1e3e00002003/635b1e3e00002129` (PtpB phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphatase activity). The second one lacks evidence annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Location Clarification**: While the model correctly places PtpB activities in the host cell plasma membrane (GO:0020002), the specific relationship between the bacterial protein's translocation to the host cell and its activities could be more explicitly modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Biological Process Context**: While the model includes the biological process \"symbiont-mediated suppression of host defense-related programmed cell death\" (GO:0034054) for PtpB activities, it might also include \"symbiont-mediated suppression of host inflammatory response\" (GO:0052036) as mentioned in the UniProt entry for PtpB.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove Redundant Associations**: Remove the duplicate causal association from PtpB ubiquitin binding to PtpB phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphatase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Additional Biological Processes**: Consider adding \"symbiont-mediated suppression of host inflammatory response\" (GO:0052036) to better capture the broader biological impact of PtpB's activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider Adding Host Response Context**: The model could potentially benefit from including additional activities related to the host immune response that are suppressed by this mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarify Protein Secretion Mechanism**: While outside the immediate scope of this model, it might be valuable to note that the mechanism by which PtpB is secreted from M. tuberculosis and enters host cells is not fully characterized.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model effectively represents the inhibition of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis by M. tuberculosis PtpB phosphatase. It captures the key molecular mechanisms and causal relationships between the bacterial phosphatase activities and the disruption of host GSDMD membrane localization and function. With minor adjustments, particularly removing the redundant causal association, the model provides a clear and scientifically accurate representation of this pathogen-host interaction mechanism.\n",

      "**Taxon**: Mouse (NCBITaxon:10090)  \n",
      "**Status**: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the glucagon signaling pathway in mouse, focusing on the cellular response to glucagon stimulus. The model includes 6 molecular activities and their causal relationships, covering the typical pathway from glucagon binding to its receptor through G-protein signaling, adenylate cyclase activation, and protein kinase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the canonical glucagon signaling pathway where:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Gcg (glucagon) binds to Gcgr (glucagon receptor)\n",
      "2. Gcgr activates G protein (Gnas)\n",
      "3. G protein activates adenylate cyclase (Adcy8)\n",
      "4. Adenylate cyclase inhibition affects protein kinase A regulatory subunit (Prkar1a)\n",
      "5. PKA regulatory subunit inhibits PKA catalytic subunit (Prkaca)\n",
      "\n",
      "This flow of activities correctly represents the mechanism of glucagon signaling according to the literature, particularly as described in PMID:30380405.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper molecular function assignments**: Each protein is assigned appropriate molecular functions (e.g., glucagon receptor activity for Gcgr, G protein activity for Gnas, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct cellular locations**: Activities are placed in appropriate cellular locations (plasma membrane for receptor and G-protein activities, cytosol for downstream components)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Well-evidenced**: Most activities are supported by experimental evidence with appropriate references (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence, ECO:0000315 - mutant phenotype evidence)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Correct causal relationships**: The causal relationships between activities are biologically accurate:\n",
      "   - Glucagon receptor activation by glucagon (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates)\n",
      "   - G protein activation by receptor (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates)\n",
      "   - Adenylate cyclase activation by G protein (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates)\n",
      "   - Protein kinase A regulation properly captured with negative regulation (RO:0002630)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Appropriate biological process context**: All activities are correctly placed within the \"cellular response to glucagon stimulus\" (GO:0071377) biological process\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Direct Evidence for Some Causal Relationships**: Some causal links don't have specific evidence annotations (e.g., the causal association between Gcgr activity and Gnas activity). Evidence should ideally be provided for each causal relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lack of Downstream Effectors**: The model doesn't extend beyond PKA activation to show the downstream metabolic effects of glucagon signaling (e.g., glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis). These processes are mentioned in the referenced studies and are key outcomes of glucagon signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Cell Type Annotation**: While the model is annotated at the cellular component level, it doesn't specify the cell type (likely hepatocytes) where this signaling occurs. The model includes CL:0000182 (hepatocyte) in its objects but doesn't use it in the activity annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **No cAMP Representation**: The model doesn't explicitly represent cAMP as an intermediate signaling molecule between adenylate cyclase and PKA, which is a key component of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Incomplete PKA Mechanism**: The inhibitory mechanism of PKA regulation could be more clearly represented. In the classical model, cAMP binding to regulatory subunits causes their dissociation from catalytic subunits, allowing the latter to phosphorylate target proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows the GO-CAM guidelines for signaling receptor activity and pathway representation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ligand-receptor relationship**: Correctly modeled with glucagon having \"receptor ligand activity\" and causing direct positive regulation of the glucagon receptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Receptor annotation**: Receptor is properly annotated with \"glucagon receptor activity\" and located in the plasma membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream signaling**: The downstream signaling components are connected with appropriate causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex representation**: The model doesn't include protein complexes, but this appears appropriate for this pathway where individual proteins are well-characterized.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a solid GO-CAM model that accurately represents the core glucagon signaling pathway. To enhance its completeness and utility, I recommend:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Adding evidence annotations for all causal relationships\n",
      "2. Extending the model to include downstream metabolic effects of PKA activation\n",
      "3. Adding cell type context (hepatocyte) to the annotations\n",
      "4. Considering the addition of cAMP as a small molecule mediator between adenylate cyclase and PKA\n",
      "5. Clarifying the PKA regulatory mechanism\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed model that provides valuable information about glucagon signaling. With the suggested improvements, it would provide a more comprehensive representation of the pathway.\n",

      "## Model Summary\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the molecular pathway by which the CRL4-DCAF12 ubiquitin ligase complex controls the levels of MOV10 RNA helicase during T cell activation in humans. The model describes how DCAF12 (Q5T6F0) acts as a substrate receptor in a CUL4A-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, recognizing the C-terminal acidic degron (glutamic acid-leucine motif) of MOV10 RNA helicase (Q9HCE1) and targeting it for ubiquitin-dependent degradation via the proteasome.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "The model consists of four main molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **MOV10 RNA helicase activity** (GO:0032574)\n",
      "   - Enabled by: MOV10 (UniProtKB:Q9HCE1)\n",
      "   - Part of: miRNA-mediated gene silencing by mRNA destabilization (GO:0035279)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **RBX1 ubiquitin protein ligase activity** (GO:0061630)\n",

      "   - Part of: ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the C-end degron rule pathway (GO:0140627)\n",
      "   - Location: Cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - Causal connection: Directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) MOV10 RNA helicase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **CUL4A ubiquitin ligase complex scaffold activity** (GO:0160072)\n",
      "   - Enabled by: CUL4A (UniProtKB:Q13619)\n",
      "   - Part of: ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the C-end degron rule pathway (GO:0140627)\n",

      "   - Part of: ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the C-end degron rule pathway (GO:0140627)\n",
      "   - Location: Cell component (GO:0005575)\n",
      "   - Causal connection: Provides input for (RO:0002413) RBX1 ubiquitin protein ligase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Flow\n",
      "The model's causal flow correctly represents the process by which the CRL4-DCAF12 complex regulates MOV10:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. CUL4A acts as a scaffold that positively regulates DCAF12 substrate adaptor activity\n",
      "2. DCAF12 acts as the substrate receptor that recognizes MOV10's C-terminal degron\n",
      "3. DCAF12 provides input for RBX1 ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "4. RBX1's ubiquitin ligase activity directly negatively regulates MOV10 RNA helicase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Literature Support and Evidence\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the primary literature, particularly the paper PMID:34065512, which directly identifies MOV10 as a substrate of the CRL4-DCAF12 complex and demonstrates its role in T cell activation. The paper provides strong experimental evidence for each aspect of the model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. DCAF12 directly recognizes the C-terminal -EL motif of MOV10\n",
      "2. This interaction leads to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MOV10\n",
      "3. The process is particularly important during T cell activation\n",
      "4. The degradation of MOV10 is dependent on the CRL4 complex\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Accurate representation of the pathway**: The model correctly represents the molecular functions and causal relationships described in the literature.\n",
      "2. **Well-supported by evidence**: Each activity and relationship is backed by experimental evidence from published literature.\n",
      "3. **Appropriate GO terms**: The molecular functions, cellular locations, and biological processes are represented with accurate GO terms.\n",
      "4. **Proper relationship predicates**: The causal connections use appropriate relationship predicates that accurately reflect the biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Concerns:\n",
      "1. **Cellular location annotation for MOV10**: MOV10's activity is annotated as occurring in \"cellular_component\" (GO:0005575), which is a root term. According to the literature, MOV10 is primarily located in the cytoplasm (specifically in P-bodies) during T cell activation. A more specific location term would improve the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence for MOV10 function**: The MOV10 activity is supported by ECO:0000250 (sequence similarity evidence) with UniProtKB:P23249 as reference. While this is acceptable, direct experimental evidence would be stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological context**: While the model correctly represents T cell activation in the title and context, it could benefit from explicitly connecting to T cell activation processes in the causal chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Update MOV10 location**: Replace the general GO:0005575 term with a more specific term such as GO:0000932 (P-body) or at minimum GO:0005737 (cytoplasm) to better reflect MOV10's subcellular location during T cell activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add additional supporting evidence**: If available, include direct experimental evidence for MOV10's RNA helicase activity from human studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider expanding the model**: The paper mentions that this pathway is particularly important during T cell activation. Consider connecting this pathway to T cell activation processes (GO:0042110) more explicitly in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Possible expansion**: Consider including the destabilization of the C-terminal degron motif (-EL) of MOV10 as part of the causal chain, as this is the specific recognition mechanism described in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:636d9ce800001192 provides an accurate and well-supported representation of the molecular pathway by which the CRL4-DCAF12 complex regulates MOV10 during T cell activation.

      "2. **T cell activation aspect**: The model title and content focus on spermatogenesis, but the paper demonstrates that DCAF12 also controls MOV10 during T cell activation. A complementary model or extension of this model to include the T cell context would provide a more complete representation of the biology described in the paper.\n",

      "# GO-CAM Model Review: Positive regulation of gluconeogenesis 1 (Mouse)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the positive regulation of gluconeogenesis in mouse. It includes several key enzymes involved in the gluconeogenesis pathway and illustrates the regulatory relationship between cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate metabolism, which plays a critical role in regulating the balance between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the following components of the gluconeogenesis pathway in mouse:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Key enzymes in gluconeogenesis pathway**:\n",
      "   - Glucose-6-phosphatase activity (G6pc1, MGI:MGI:95607)\n",
      "   - Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase activity (Gpi1, MGI:MGI:95797)\n",
      "   - Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphatase activity (Fbp1, MGI:MGI:95492)\n",
      "   - Glucose 6-phosphate:phosphate antiporter activity (Slc37a4, MGI:MGI:1316650)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regulatory components**:\n",
      "   - cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (Prkaca, MGI:MGI:97592)\n",
      "   - Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase activity (Pfkfb1, MGI:MGI:107816)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model appropriately captures several important causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Prkaca) directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) the fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase activity (Pfkfb1). This is consistent with literature showing that PKA can phosphorylate and activate the phosphatase activity of the bifunctional enzyme Pfkfb1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase (Pfkfb1) provides input for (RO:0002413) glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Gpi1) and directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphatase (Fbp1).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The model correctly shows how the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Gpi1) provides input for (RO:0002413) the glucose 6-phosphate:phosphate antiporter (Slc37a4).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Both fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphatase (Fbp1) and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase (Pfkfb1) provide input for (RO:0002413) glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Gpi1).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The glucose 6-phosphate:phosphate antiporter (Slc37a4) provides input for (RO:0002413) glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc1), which is the final step in glucose production.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- ECO:0000316 (genetic interaction evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- ECO:0000266 (sequence orthology evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each assertion is supported by appropriate PMIDs, though some causal associations lack specific evidence annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly represents the key enzymatic steps in gluconeogenesis and their regulatory relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Inclusion of regulatory components**: The inclusion of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase reflects the important regulatory mechanism where glucagon acts via PKA to promote gluconeogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consistent causal flow**: The model maintains a logical flow of activities that matches the known pathway of gluconeogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Input/output relationships**: The model correctly includes CHEBI:28602 (beta-D-fructofuranose 2,6-bisphosphate) as an input for the fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Evidence for Some Causal Relationships**: Some causal associations lack specific evidence annotations. These should be added to strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional Contextual Detail**: The model doesn't explicitly show the hormonal context (e.g., glucagon) that triggers cAMP elevation and subsequent PKA activation. Adding this upstream component would enhance the model's completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expanded Regulatory Mechanism**: The model could benefit from explicitly showing how the reduction of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels by Pfkfb1 relieves the inhibition of Fbp1, which is a key regulatory mechanism in the switch from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular Connection to Metabolic State**: Adding information about how this pathway is connected to the fasting state or low blood glucose levels would provide important physiological context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:636d9ce800002041](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:636d9ce800002041) provides an accurate representation of the positive regulation of gluconeogenesis in mouse. It correctly captures the key enzymes involved in the pathway and the regulatory role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in promoting gluconeogenesis through the modulation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels. With minor additions as suggested, it could provide an even more comprehensive representation of this essential metabolic pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Activities and Associations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SETD2 Activity (Q9BYW2)**:\n",
      "   - Molecular function: Protein-lysine N-methyltransferase activity (GO:0016279)\n",
      "   - Part of: Positive regulation of autophagy (GO:0010508)\n",
      "   - Negatively regulates: TRIM21's ubiquitin protein ligase activity\n",
      "   - Evidence: ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) from PMID:28753426\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **TRIM21 Activity (P19474)**:\n",

      "   - Negatively regulates: FIP200/RB1CC1's protein kinase binding\n",
      "   - Evidence: ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) from PMID:36359729\n",

      "   - Target of TRIM21's negative regulation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Control Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. **Scientific Accuracy**: \n",
      "   - The model accurately represents the molecular mechanism described in PMID:36359729, which shows that TRIM21 ubiquitinates FIP200 at K1133, leading to its degradation and inhibiting autophagy.\n",
      "   - The representation of SETD2's role in methylating FIP200, which prevents TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination, is consistent with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Structure**:\n",
      "   - The causal connections using RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) are appropriate.\n",
      "   - The directional flow from SETD2 inhibiting TRIM21 activity, and TRIM21 inhibiting FIP200 activity is logical.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper Evidence**:\n",
      "   - Evidence codes are correctly used (ECO:0000314 for direct assay evidence).\n",
      "   - All assertions are backed by appropriate literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**:\n",
      "   - According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidance, FIP200/RB1CC1 is part of the ATG1/ULK1 kinase complex. The model correctly notes this, but could be enhanced by including more detailed information about other complex members that might be affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular Detail**:\n",
      "   - The specific lysine residue (K1133) on FIP200 that gets methylated by SETD2 and ubiquitinated by TRIM21 is not explicitly mentioned in the model, though it's a key detail in the paper.\n",
      "   - The model doesn't explicitly capture that ubiquitination leads to protein degradation via the proteasome pathway, which is the mechanism of inhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Duplicate Causal Association**:\n",
      "   - There appears to be a duplicate causal association from SETD2 to TRIM21 (two instances of RO:0002630), with one of them lacking evidence, which should be removed or properly annotated.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological Process Context**:\n",
      "   - While the model does include that FIP200 is part of autophagosome assembly (GO:0000045), it could more clearly represent that TRIM21-mediated degradation of FIP200 specifically affects autophagy initiation, as described in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate Use of Predicates**:\n",
      "   - The model correctly uses RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) to indicate inhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Compartment Annotation**:\n",
      "   - The model correctly places TRIM21 in the cytoplasm and FIP200 in the ATG1/ULK1 kinase complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence and References**:\n",
      "   - All activities have appropriate evidence codes and references, which is in line with best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove Duplicate Causal Association**:\n",
      "   - There's a duplicate causal association from SETD2 to TRIM21 with no evidence, which should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Detail about Mechanism**:\n",
      "   - Consider adding annotations to explicitly indicate that TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination leads to proteasomal degradation of FIP200.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Specify Modification Site**:\n",
      "   - Consider adding a note about K1133 being the specific site of both methylation and ubiquitination, which is key to the competitive mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complete the Pathway Context**:\n",
      "   - The model could better represent that this mechanism regulates autophagy initiation rather than just general autophagy.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:63894f2500000740) provides a good representation of the molecular interactions involved in TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination of FIP200 and its inhibition by SETD2-mediated methylation. The model accurately captures the key molecular functions and biological processes described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be improved by removing the duplicate causal association, adding more details about the specific modification site and mechanism of inhibition, and more clearly representing the impact on autophagy initiation. These refinements would make the model more informative and precise for users seeking to understand this regulatory pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Model Review: gomodel:63894f2500000870\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the molecular mechanisms by which FXR1 (Fragile X Related 1) protein functions in translation regulation via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and how FXR1 itself is regulated through phosphorylation and ubiquitination. The model includes activities from various proteins including FXR1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO4, GSK3β kinase, and the translation initiation factor EIF4A1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate representation of molecular activities**: The model appropriately captures FXR1's known function in molecular condensate scaffold activity (GO:0140693) and mRNA 3'-UTR binding (GO:0003730) based on recent literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Properly connected causal relationships**: The model correctly represents the relationship between FXR1's condensate scaffold activity leading to translation initiation factor activity of EIF4A1, which is supported by the literature (PMID:34731628).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Accurate representation of regulation**: The model correctly captures GSK3β's role in phosphorylating FBXO4, which then targets FXR1 for ubiquitination, as demonstrated in PMID:29142209.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate evidence codes**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes for the assertions made, including sequence similarity evidence (ECO:0000250) when citing research in mouse (MGI identifiers), and direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) when citing direct experimental support.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing molecular function for GSK3β**: While GSK3β (UniProtKB:P49841) is shown to have \"protein serine/threonine kinase activity\" (GO:0004674), the specific target of this phosphorylation in the model is not explicitly connected. The literature shows GSK3β phosphorylates FBXO4, which primes it for ubiquitination of FXR1. The causal relationship is shown, but a more specific annotation of the target would improve the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider including the entire SCF complex**: From PMID:29142209, it's clear that FBXO4 functions as part of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) E3 ligase complex. The model currently shows only FBXO4 with the ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity (GO:1990756), but following the annotation guidance for complexes, it could be improved by including the other components of the SCF complex with their respective activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback regulation could be represented**: The literature (PMID:29142209) describes a feedback loop where FXR1 translational represses FBXO4 by binding to its mRNA 3'-UTR. This important regulatory mechanism is not captured in the current model and could be added to provide a more complete understanding of the biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider adding cellular locations for more activities**: While some activities have cellular locations specified (such as FXR1's molecular condensate scaffold activity occurring in intracellular membraneless organelle), others don't have locations specified. Adding these locations would enhance the model's completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Include the role of phosphorylation in FXR1 function**: The literature indicates that phosphorylation of FXR1 at specific sites regulates its function, but this isn't fully captured in the current model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is generally biologically accurate based on the current literature. The model correctly represents:\n",
      "\n",
      "- FXR1's role in translation activation through its molecular condensate scaffold activity and mRNA binding\n",
      "- The regulation of FXR1 by GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent FBXO4-mediated ubiquitination\n",
      "- The role of EIF4A1 in translation initiation following recruitment by FXR1\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientific evidence provided (from PMIDs 35951695, 34731628, 29142209, and 30704899) supports these assertions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices Conformity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows most GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "- Uses appropriate molecular function terms\n",
      "- Properly connects activities with causal relationships\n",
      "- Includes appropriate cellular locations where activities occur\n",
      "- Utilizes proper evidence codes with relevant references\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the model could better conform to best practices by:\n",
      "- More explicitly modeling the SCF complex components (as described in the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidance)\n",
      "- Adding more specific cellular locations for all activities where known\n",
      "- Including all relevant causal relationships described in the literature\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a good representation of FXR1 function in translation regulation and its own regulation through the GSK3β-FBXO4 axis. The model is scientifically accurate based on current literature and follows most GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the model, I recommend:\n",
      "1. Adding the other components of the SCF E3 ligase complex\n",
      "2. Including the feedback regulation where FXR1 inhibits FBXO4 translation\n",
      "3. Adding more specific cellular locations for all activities\n",
      "4. Potentially expanding the model to include additional functions of FXR1 in LLPS-dependent processes\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed model that effectively captures a complex biological process and would be even stronger with these suggested additions.\n",

      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: gomodel:63894f2500001748\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the process of \"FRM1 binds N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export (Human)\" and includes four main activities centered around the modification and nuclear export of m6A-containing mRNAs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model describes a functional pathway where:\n",
      "1. METTL14 has mRNA binding activity\n",
      "2. METTL3 has mRNA m(6)A methyltransferase activity\n",
      "3. FMR1 has N6-methyladenosine-containing RNA reader activity\n",
      "4. XPO1 functions as a nuclear export signal receptor\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of the m6A RNA modification and export pathway. Key literature supports that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The METTL3-METTL14 complex forms an active methyltransferase that adds m6A modifications to RNA. METTL3 is the catalytic component while METTL14 functions mainly as an RNA-binding scaffold to stabilize the complex and enhance RNA substrate recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. FMR1 (FMRP) can recognize and bind to m6A-modified RNAs through its N6-methyladenosine-containing RNA reader activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. XPO1 (Exportin-1/CRM1) functions as a nuclear export signal receptor for the export of these modified mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The directionality of the pathway is correctly represented with METTL14's mRNA binding activity directly positively regulating METTL3's m6A methyltransferase activity, which in turn directly positively regulates FMR1's m6A reader activity, which then directly positively regulates XPO1's nuclear export receptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows best practices for GO-CAM modeling:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate relations between activities**: The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) to connect activities in a causal chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Protein annotation**: Each activity is appropriately enabled by a specific protein (UniProtKB identifiers).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular localization**: Activities are correctly annotated with cellular locations. The METTL3/METTL14 activities and FMR1 activity occur in the nucleus (GO:0005634), consistent with where m6A modification and initial recognition would take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Process association**: Each activity is associated with the appropriate biological process:\n",
      "   - METTL14 and METTL3 activities are part of mRNA modification (GO:0016556)\n",
      "   - FMR1 and XPO1 activities are part of mRNA export from nucleus (GO:0006406)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence annotation**: All activities and relationships are supported by appropriate evidence codes and literature references, primarily using ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) with citations to relevant publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is well constructed, I have a few suggestions for possible enhancements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Detailed molecular mechanism**: The model could potentially be expanded to include more detail about how FMR1 recognizes m6A-modified mRNAs. Literature suggests that FMR1 contains specific domains involved in this recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional regulators**: The literature indicates that this pathway may involve additional regulators like YTHDC1, which also functions as an m6A reader protein in the nucleus. Including this could provide a more complete picture of the m6A-mediated export pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Temporal aspects**: The model could potentially include information about when in the mRNA lifecycle these modifications and export events occur (e.g., during or after transcription, relation to splicing).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Subcellular localization**: While nuclear localization is included, more specific nuclear structures (like nuclear speckles) could be added if supported by evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:63894f2500001748) is a high-quality representation of the process by which FMR1 binds N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export in humans. The model is biologically accurate, well-structured according to GO-CAM guidelines, and properly evidenced. It effectively captures the causal chain of molecular activities involved in this specific mRNA processing pathway.\n",
      "\n",

      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:63894f2500001789](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:63894f2500001789) titled \"Fmr1 binds N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export (Mouse)\" represents a pathway for mRNA export from the nucleus facilitated by m6A modification and FMRP protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the biological pathway described in the primary literature (PMID: [31340148](https://bioregistry.io/pmid:31340148)), which demonstrates that FMRP functions as an m6A reader that promotes nuclear export of methylated mRNAs during neural differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the following key aspects of the pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Mettl14 ([MGI:MGI:2442926](https://bioregistry.io/mgi:MGI:2442926)) binds mRNA in the nucleus\n",
      "2. This facilitates Mettl3 ([MGI:MGI:1927165](https://bioregistry.io/mgi:MGI:1927165)) to perform mRNA m6A methyltransferase activity\n",
      "3. Fmr1 ([MGI:MGI:95564](https://bioregistry.io/mgi:MGI:95564)) acts as an m6A reader with N6-methyladenosine-containing RNA reader activity\n",
      "4. Fmr1 directly positively regulates Xpo1 ([MGI:MGI:2144013](https://bioregistry.io/mgi:MGI:2144013)), which has nuclear export signal receptor activity\n",
      "5. This cascade results in mRNA export from the nucleus\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relations\n",
      "The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) to show the causal flow from one activity to another, creating a logical pathway from mRNA binding through m6A modification, m6A reading, and finally nuclear export.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence and References\n",
      "Each activity has appropriate evidence codes and literature references:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) for most activities\n",
      "- ECO:0000250 (sequence similarity evidence) for Mettl14's mRNA binding\n",
      "- ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence) for Mettl14's role in mRNA modification\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Components\n",
      "The model correctly specifies that activities occur in the nucleus (GO:0005634), which is essential for understanding mRNA export.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Functions\n",
      "The molecular functions are appropriate for each protein:\n",
      "- GO:0003729 (mRNA binding) for Mettl14\n",
      "- GO:0001734 (mRNA m6A methyltransferase activity) for Mettl3\n",

      "- GO:0005049 (nuclear export signal receptor activity) for Xpo1\n",
      "\n",
      "## Improvement Opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally sound, a few improvements could be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inclusion of the complex**: According to the literature and the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, Mettl3 and Mettl14 form a heterodimeric complex where Mettl14 serves as the RNA-binding scaffold and Mettl3 is the catalytic component. The model could potentially represent this as a complex, especially since the precise activities of each component are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Representation of CRM1/XPO1 mechanism**: The model could add that Fmr1 interacts with CRM1 (Xpo1) via its nuclear export sequence (NES) to facilitate nuclear export, as detailed in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Target specificity**: The model could note that this pathway specifically affects m6A-modified mRNAs related to neural differentiation, such as components of the Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Automated change note**: The model contains a note about \"GO:0080009 replaced by GO:0016556\" (mRNA modification). This appears to be a valid ontology update.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",

      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:63894f2500001789](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:63894f2500001789) is a high-quality representation of the m6A-dependent mRNA nuclear export pathway facilitated by FMRP.

The model is well-supported by evidence and provides a clear understanding of how FMRP reads m6A-modified mRNAs to promote their nuclear export during neural differentiation.\n",

      "### Biological Content Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the findings from the primary reference (PMID:28594402), which demonstrates that ARRDC4 acts as an adaptor protein that interacts with MDA5 and recruits TRIM65 to promote K63-linked ubiquitination of MDA5, enhancing downstream signaling through MAVS.\n",

      "1. TRIM65's ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "2. ARRDC4's ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity (GO:1990756)\n",

      "- ARRDC4 directly positively regulates TRIM65 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "- TRIM65 directly positively regulates MAVS (RO:0002629)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Location Appropriateness\n",
      "\n",
      "The cellular locations are correctly annotated based on the literature:\n",
      "- TRIM65 activity occurs in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737), supported by PMID:34512673\n",
      "- ARRDC4 activity is correctly placed in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "- MAVS activity is correctly placed on the mitochondrial membrane (GO:0031966), supported by PMID:20451243\n",

      "- ECO:0000305 (curator inference used in manual assertion) for the ARRDC4 location\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Modeling Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the GO-CAM modeling guidelines for complexes, this model follows the recommended approach where the specific proteins carrying the activities are known and represented individually rather than using a complex ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow in the model appropriately represents how ARRDC4 acts as an adapter to recruit TRIM65, which then ubiquitinates MDA5, leading to MAVS activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Identified Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "I noted a minor issue in the model related to causal relationships. There appears to be a duplicate causal association:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"type\": \"CausalAssociation\",\n",
      "  \"evidence\": [],\n",

      "  \"downstream_activity\": \"gomodel:63894f2500001894/63894f2500001898\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a redundant entry without evidence that duplicates another causal relationship between ARRDC4 and TRIM65.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove Duplicate Causal Association**: The empty evidence causal association between ARRDC4 and TRIM65 should be removed as it's redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add More Molecular Detail**: The model could potentially be enhanced by adding more detailed information about:\n",
      "   - The specific lysine residue (K743) on MDA5 that is ubiquitinated by TRIM65, as mentioned in the paper\n",
      "   - The specific protein-protein interaction domains involved (e.g., ARRDC4's arrestin-like N domain interacts with MDA5)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Process Annotation**: While the model correctly shows that both TRIM65 and ARRDC4 participate in \"protein K63-linked ubiquitination\" (GO:0070534), it might be valuable to add additional biological process annotations to MAVS, such as \"positive regulation of interferon-beta production\" (GO:0032728), as this is the downstream outcome of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model accurately represents the biological pathway described in the primary literature. The model effectively captures the role of ARRDC4 as an adaptor protein that promotes TRIM65-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of MDA5, leading to MAVS activation and subsequent innate immune response. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities and their causal relationships.\n",

      "## Detailed Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the canonical understanding of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate-mediated regulation of glycolysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pfkfb1** catalyzes the synthesis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate from fructose-6-phosphate, which is supported by evidence from PMID:12230553.\n",
      "- **Pfkl** is positively regulated by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, enhancing glycolytic flux, as evidenced in PMID:8172601 and PMID:35530161.\n",
      "- **Gpi1** provides input for the Pfkfb1 activity, consistent with its role in converting glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate (PMID:2344351).\n",
      "- **Ppp2ca** (Protein phosphatase 2A) positively regulates Pfkfb1 activity, consistent with its known role in dephosphorylating and thus activating Pfkfb1, as supported by PMID:7592845.\n",
      "\n",
      "The molecular interactions and causal relationships depicted in the model align with the known biochemistry of glycolysis regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Model Structure and Completeness\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the core components necessary to understand the positive regulation of glycolysis through fructose-2,6-bisphosphate:\n",
      "\n",
      "- All activities are appropriately enabled by specific gene products.\n",
      "- Cellular locations are specified when known (e.g., Pfkfb1 and Gpi1 in cytosol).\n",
      "- Molecular functions are correctly assigned (e.g., 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity for Pfkfb1).\n",
      "- Biological processes are properly indicated (e.g., Pfkl's participation in glycolytic process through fructose-6-phosphate).\n",
      "- Causal relationships are clearly defined using appropriate relationship predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Strengths:\n",

      "- Where homology-based evidence is used, appropriate \"with\" references are included.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Complex representation**: The model appropriately represents individual proteins rather than complexes since the activities are carried out by specific subunits.\n",
      "- **Causal relationships**: The model correctly uses the \"directly positively regulates\" predicate (RO:0002629) for the regulatory relationships and \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) for metabolic input relationships.\n",
      "- **Activity flow**: The activities are connected in a logical flow that represents the biological pathway.\n",
      "- **Parsimony**: The model is concise while capturing the essential regulatory relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Validation Against Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientific literature supports the relationships depicted in the model:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **PMID:12230553** describes the role of Fru-2,6-P2 in regulating hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, supporting the positive regulatory role of Pfkfb1 on glycolysis.\n",
      "- **PMID:8172601** supports the role of Pfkl in the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, an essential step in glycolysis.\n",
      "- **PMID:2344351** validates the role of Gpi1 (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) in the early steps of glycolysis.\n",

      "- **PMID:35530161** supports the involvement of Pfkl in the glycolytic process through fructose-6-phosphate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Isoform Specificity and Tissue Context\n",
      "\n",
      "The model appropriately represents:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The specific mouse isoforms of the proteins involved (Pfkfb1, Pfkl, Gpi1, Ppp2ca).\n",
      "- The tissue context is implied to be liver-specific based on the liver-type Pfkl and the evidence used.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my review, this model is scientifically accurate and adheres to GO-CAM best practices. It provides a clear representation of the positive regulation of glycolysis through fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Minor Suggestions for Enhancement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add metabolic inputs/outputs for Pfkl**: While the model shows Pfkl participating in glycolysis, adding its specific substrate (fructose-6-phosphate) and product (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate) would enhance clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include the phosphorylation state details**: The model could specify that Ppp2ca regulates Pfkfb1 by dephosphorylating specific residues, shifting the kinase/phosphatase activity ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider expanding the model**: The model could be expanded to include additional regulatory inputs to Pfkfb1 (e.g., hormone signaling) or to show downstream glycolytic steps affected by increased Pfkl activity.\n",

      "2. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase activity (Pfkfb1)\n",
      "3. cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (Prkaca)\n",

      "## Structure and Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Functions and Proteins:\n",
      "1. **Pfkl (MGI:MGI:97547)** - 6-phosphofructokinase activity (GO:0003872)\n",
      "   - This is correctly annotated as participating in glycolytic process through fructose-6-phosphate (GO:0061615)\n",
      "   - The UniProt information confirms this is appropriate, as Pfkl is a key enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate\n",

      "2. **Prkaca (MGI:MGI:97592)** - cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (GO:0004691)\n",
      "   - Correctly annotated as participating in negative regulation of glycolytic process (GO:0045820)\n",
      "   - The literature (PMID:16155866) supports this function, showing that PKA activity from this catalytic subunit can lead to decreased glycolysis\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pfkfb1 (MGI:MGI:107816)** - fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase activity (GO:0004331)\n",

      "   - Has input of beta-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate(4-) (CHEBI:58579)\n",
      "   - The UniProt entry confirms Pfkfb1 has both kinase and phosphatase activities, and phosphorylation by PKA shifts it toward phosphatase activity\n",

      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships:\n",
      "1. **Causal relationship 1**: Prkaca directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) Pfkfb1\n",
      "   - This is supported by the literature. PMID:16155866 shows that PKA phosphorylates Pfkfb1, which shifts its activity toward the phosphatase function.\n",
      "   - The UniProt entry for Pfkfb1 confirms that \"phosphorylation at Ser-33 inhibits the kinase and activates the bisphosphatase\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationship 2**: Pfkfb1 directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) Pfkl\n",
      "   - This is accurate as the phosphatase activity of Pfkfb1 degrades fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which is an activator of Pfkl\n",
      "   - The decrease in F-2,6-P2 levels leads to decreased activity of phosphofructokinase, inhibiting glycolysis\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relationship 3**: Gpi1 provides input for (RO:0002413) Pfkfb1\n",
      "   - This is accurate as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase produces fructose-6-phosphate, which is a substrate for Pfkfb1\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The pathway described in this model is biologically accurate and consistent with current knowledge:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PKA (Prkaca) phosphorylates and activates the phosphatase activity of Pfkfb1\n",
      "2. Activated phosphatase activity of Pfkfb1 decreases the levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate\n",
      "3. Decreased fructose-2,6-bisphosphate leads to decreased activity of phosphofructokinase (Pfkl)\n",
      "4. This ultimately leads to negative regulation of glycolysis\n",
      "\n",
      "This is consistent with the literature, including PMID:16155866, which demonstrates that constitutively active PKA leads to decreased levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and inhibition of glycolysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Representation of molecule activities**: The model correctly represents the molecular functions of each protein and their roles in biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates:\n",
      "   - RO:0002413 (provides input for) for enzymatic reactions where one enzyme produces a substrate for another\n",

      "4. **Evidence**: Each annotation has appropriate evidence codes and references to literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use of complexes**: This model does not involve complexes, so the complex annotation guidelines do not apply here.\n",

      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is accurate and well-constructed, a few potential improvements could be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional molecular details**: The model could potentially include the fact that Prkaca phosphorylates Pfkfb1 at Ser-33, which is a specific mechanism that shifts the activity of Pfkfb1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional biochemical context**: The model could include ATP as an input for both Prkaca and Pfkl activities, as both are kinases that use ATP.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expanded pathway context**: The model could be expanded to include how this regulation fits into the broader context of metabolic regulation, possibly including:\n",
      "   - The role of glucagon in activating PKA\n",
      "   - The connection to gluconeogenesis, which is often upregulated when glycolysis is downregulated\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model titled \"positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter by glucose 1 (Mouse)\" describes the molecular pathway of glucose-responsive transcriptional regulation in mouse hepatocytes, focusing on the role of ChREBP (Mlxipl) in activating genes involved in glycolysis and lipid synthesis.\n",

      "## Model Structure and Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes 5 key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Kat2b activity**: Peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity (GO:0061733)\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Mlxipl activity**: DNA-binding transcription activator activity (GO:0001228)\n",
      "   - Enabled by: Mlxipl/ChREBP (MGI:MGI:1927999)\n",
      "   - Occurs in: nucleus (GO:0005634) \n",
      "   - Part of: positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter by glucose (GO:0000432)\n",
      "   - Causally regulates: Pklr activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mlx activity**: RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding (GO:0061629)\n",
      "   - Enabled by: Mlx (MGI:MGI:108398)\n",
      "   - Occurs in: nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "   - Part of: positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter by glucose (GO:0000432)\n",
      "   - Causally regulates: Mlxipl activity\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pklr activity**: Pyruvate kinase activity (GO:0004743)\n",
      "   - Enabled by: Pklr (MGI:MGI:97604)\n",
      "   - Occurs in: cytosol (GO:0005829)\n",
      "   - Part of: glycolytic process (GO:0006096)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Sik2 activity**: Protein serine kinase activity (GO:0106310)\n",
      "   - Enabled by: Sik2 (MGI:MGI:2445031)\n",
      "   - Part of: negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter by glucose (GO:0061987)\n",
      "   - Causally regulates (negatively): Kat2b activity and Pklr activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model effectively captures the glucose-responsive transcriptional regulatory pathway, showing how glucose regulates transcription through ChREBP (Mlxipl) and its cofactors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The causal relationships between activities are well represented, using appropriate relationship predicates (RO:0002629 for direct positive regulation, RO:0002630 for direct negative regulation, and RO:0002407 for positive regulation).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular context**: The model correctly annotates the subcellular locations of the activities (nucleus for transcription factors, cytosol for metabolic enzymes).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process context**: Each activity is appropriately placed in its relevant biological process context.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence base**: The model is supported by experimental evidence from relevant publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing activity context**: Sik2 activity lacks a specified cellular compartment annotation. Based on its function in regulating transcription factors, I recommend adding:\n",
      "   - Occurs in: cytosol or nucleus (depending on specific localization data)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regulatory mechanism clarification**: The model indicates that Sik2 directly negatively regulates both Kat2b and Pklr activities. Based on the literature reviewed (PMID:21084751), Sik2 regulates p300 phosphorylation which affects ChREBP acetylation. The direct negative regulation of Pklr by Sik2 may need reconsideration, as it's more likely an indirect effect through the transcriptional cascade.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Consider revising the causal relationship from Sik2 to Pklr to an indirect negative regulation relationship or remove this direct connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing molecular context**: The model doesn't include O-GlcNAcylation of ChREBP, which is an important post-translational modification affecting ChREBP stability and activity as described in PMID:21471514.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Consider adding O-GlcNAc transferase (Ogt) activity and its regulation of ChREBP if this aspect is relevant to the specific focus of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex formation**: According to the literature, Mlx and Mlxipl (ChREBP) function as a heterodimer. Following GO-CAM guidelines on \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\", since both proteins have defined activities, they should be represented individually as done in this model, but their interaction could be more clearly represented.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Consider adding a note or annotation clarifying the heterodimeric nature of the functional Mlx-ChREBP complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Additional supporting literature**: The model could benefit from adding references to recent literature on ChREBP regulation through acetylation and O-GlcNAcylation (e.g., PMID:21471514), especially to support the role of Kat2b in ChREBP acetylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "GO-CAM model gomodel:63a86a8600000221 provides an accurate representation of glucose-responsive transcriptional regulation in mouse hepatocytes, focusing on the key role of ChREBP (Mlxipl) in this pathway. The model effectively captures the transcriptional activation of metabolic genes through the coordinated actions of transcription factors and their regulators.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (https://bioregistry.io/go.model:63a86a8600000288) is titled \"positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter by glucose 2 (Mouse)\" and represents a pathway in *Mus musculus* (mouse) involving glucose-mediated regulation of lipid biosynthesis through ChREBP and related transcription factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model describes a regulatory pathway with several key molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Central Transcription Factor Activity**:\n",
      "   - [Mlxipl](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:1927999) (ChREBP) functions as a DNA-binding transcription activator (GO:0001228) in the nucleus\n",
      "   - [Mlx](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:108398) functions as an RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding protein (GO:0061629) in the nucleus\n",
      "   - [Kat2b](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:1343094) (p/CAF) functions as a peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase (GO:0061733) in the nucleus\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Metabolic Enzyme Activities**:\n",
      "   - [Acaca](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:108451) enables acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity (GO:0003989) in the cytosol\n",
      "   - [Fasn](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:95485) enables fatty acid synthase activity (GO:0004312) in the cytosol\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulatory Kinase Activity**:\n",
      "   - [Sik2](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:2445031) enables protein serine kinase activity (GO:0106310)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal Relationships**:\n",
      "   - Mlx directly positively regulates Mlxipl\n",
      "   - Kat2b directly positively regulates Mlxipl\n",
      "   - Mlxipl directly positively regulates both Acaca and Fasn\n",
      "   - Sik2 directly negatively regulates Kat2b, Acaca, and Fasn\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the glucose-responsive transcriptional regulation pathway involving ChREBP (Mlxipl) and its partner Mlx in the regulation of lipogenic gene expression, which is well-supported by the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ChREBP-Mlx Interaction**: The model correctly represents ChREBP (Mlxipl) and Mlx forming a functional heterodimer to regulate lipogenic gene expression. The heterodimer binds to carbohydrate response elements (ChoREs) in target gene promoters.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Acetyltransferase Regulation**: The inclusion of Kat2b (p/CAF) as a positive regulator of ChREBP activity through acetylation is supported by the literature, though p300 (not explicitly represented in this model) is also a key acetyltransferase for ChREBP.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **SIK2 Negative Regulation**: The model correctly represents SIK2 as a negative regulator of the pathway. According to Bricambert et al. (2010), SIK2 inhibits ChREBP activity by phosphorylating p300, reducing its HAT activity, which in turn reduces ChREBP acetylation and DNA binding.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Target Genes**: The model correctly includes the key lipogenic enzymes Acaca (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and Fasn (fatty acid synthase) as targets of ChREBP regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practice Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Function Annotation**: Each gene product is appropriately annotated with specific molecular functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Component**: The nuclear location of transcription factors and cytosolic location of metabolic enzymes are appropriately annotated.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological Process**: The activities are correctly linked to relevant biological processes (lipid biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal Relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates:\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for direct positive regulatory relationships\n",
      "   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for direct negative regulatory relationships\n",
      "   - RO:0002407 (directly positively regulates active state of) for transcriptional activation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing p300 Coactivator**: The model includes Kat2b (p/CAF) but not p300 (Ep300), which according to Bricambert et al. (2010) is a critical HAT for ChREBP acetylation at Lys672. This acetylation is crucial for ChREBP DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Adding p300 would provide a more complete representation of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mechanism of SIK2 Regulation**: The model shows SIK2 directly negatively regulating Kat2b, Acaca, and Fasn, but the literature suggests SIK2 primarily acts by phosphorylating p300 at Ser89, inhibiting its HAT activity. This mechanistic detail could be better represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Glucose Sensing Mechanism**: While the model title mentions \"positive regulation by glucose,\" the actual glucose sensing mechanisms (e.g., glucose metabolism to xylulose-5-phosphate, ChREBP nuclear translocation) are not explicitly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Expanded Target Gene Set**: The model could be enhanced by including additional ChREBP target genes involved in glycolysis and lipogenesis (e.g., L-PK, ACL).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Direct Assay Evidence** (ECO:0000314): Used for most protein interactions and molecular functions\n",
      "2. **Genetic Interaction Evidence** (ECO:0000316): Used for Acaca's acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity\n",
      "3. **Mutant Phenotype Evidence** (ECO:0000315): Used for Mlxipl's DNA-binding transcription activator activity\n",
      "4. **Sequence Orthology Evidence** (ECO:0000266): Used for Fasn's subcellular location\n",
      "\n",
      "The model cites relevant primary literature sources (PMID:17210641, PMID:21084751, PMID:15496471, etc.) that support the represented activities and relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the core components of glucose-mediated regulation of lipogenic gene expression through ChREBP/Mlx transcription factors. The model follows GO-CAM best practices and is supported by appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations for improvement**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Include p300 (Ep300) as a key acetyltransferase for ChREBP, with its regulation by SIK2 via Ser89 phosphorylation\n",
      "2. Clarify the mechanistic details of SIK2 regulation in the pathway\n",
      "3. Consider representing the glucose sensing mechanisms that activate ChREBP\n",
      "4. Expand the set of target genes to provide a more comprehensive view of the pathway\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a sound model that captures an important regulatory pathway linking glucose sensing to lipid metabolism, with potential relevance to metabolic disorders like fatty liver disease.\n",

      "This model (gomodel:63a86a8600000489) represents the molecular mechanisms by which TRIM22 and NT5C2 regulate RIG-I (also known as DDX58) through different forms of ubiquitination in human cells, as part of the antiviral innate immune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four activities, representing:\n",
      "1. NT5C2 (P49902) with ubiquitin protein ligase activity\n",
      "2. TRIM22 (Q8IYM9) with ubiquitin protein ligase activity\n",
      "3. RIG-I (O95786) with pattern recognition receptor activity\n",
      "4. MAVS (Q7Z434) with signaling adaptor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures how TRIM22 and NT5C2 differentially regulate RIG-I through distinct types of ubiquitination (K63-linked and K48-linked), affecting the downstream antiviral immune response pathway through MAVS.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is primarily based on the paper by Fei et al. (2022) [PMID:36159777], which provides evidence for the interaction between TRIM22, NT5C2, and RIG-I. The paper demonstrates that TRIM22 promotes K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, while NT5C2 is responsible for K48-linked ubiquitination. This dual regulation affects the RIG-I/NF-κB signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities in the model are appropriately supported by ECO evidence codes with proper references, primarily relying on direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) from the cited publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the biological mechanism described in the primary paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TRIM22 (Q8IYM9) is correctly annotated with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) and is associated with protein K63-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070534), which activates RIG-I signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. NT5C2 (P49902) is correctly annotated with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) and associated with protein K48-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070936), which negatively regulates RIG-I.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The causal relationships are appropriately captured:\n",
      "   - NT5C2 directly negatively regulates RIG-I (RO:0002630)\n",
      "   - TRIM22 directly positively regulates RIG-I (RO:0002629)\n",
      "   - RIG-I directly positively regulates MAVS (RO:0002629)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. RIG-I (O95786) is correctly placed as a pattern recognition receptor (GO:0038187), part of the antiviral innate immune response (GO:0140374).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. MAVS (Q7Z434) is appropriately represented with signaling adaptor activity (GO:0035591).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Potential Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I identified a few issues that should be addressed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redundant causal connection**: There are two identical causal connections from TRIM22 to RIG-I (both using RO:0002629). This appears to be a duplication that should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing contextual information**: Although the model describes the ubiquitination events well, it would benefit from additional information about the cellular location where this process takes place. Both proteins involved in ubiquitination should have \"occurs_in\" associations with the cytoplasm (GO:0005737), as correctly indicated for TRIM22 and RIG-I but not explicitly shown for NT5C2.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological process annotation**: The model could be enhanced by including additional biological process annotations that connect this pathway to interferon production and antiviral defense signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Improved representation of complex**: While the model shows separate activities for TRIM22 and NT5C2, the paper suggests they function as a complex. According to the GO-CAM documentation for annotating complexes, when the subunits carrying the molecular activities are known (as in this case), representing the individual proteins as separate activities is appropriate, which this model does correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows several GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "- Each protein is annotated with appropriate molecular functions\n",
      "- Each activity has appropriate \"part_of\" biological process annotations\n",
      "- Causal relationships between activities use correct predicates\n",
      "- Evidence codes with appropriate reference citations are provided\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically for E3 ligase representation, the model follows the guidelines by:\n",
      "- Using \"ubiquitin protein ligase activity\" (GO:0061630) for both E3 ligases\n",
      "- Specifying the type of ubiquitination (K48-linked vs K63-linked) in the biological process annotation\n",
      "- Using the appropriate causal relations to indicate positive or negative regulation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary and Final Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the dual regulation of RIG-I by TRIM22 and NT5C2 through different types of ubiquitination, as described in the literature. The model is well-structured, uses appropriate GO terms and relationships, and follows the GO-CAM best practices for representing E3 ubiquitin ligase activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minor issues noted above (particularly the redundant causal connection) should be addressed, but they don't significantly impact the overall quality or accuracy of the model. This model effectively captures an important regulatory mechanism in the antiviral innate immune response pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: gomodel:63a86a8600000805\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents a pathway depicting how glucose regulates transcription from RNA polymerase II promoters in mouse cells, focusing on lipid biosynthetic processes. The model includes 5 activities involving 4 proteins:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mlxipl (ChREBP)** - DNA-binding transcription activator activity\n",
      "2. **Mlx** - RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding\n",
      "3. **Acaca** - acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity\n",
      "4. **Fasn** - fatty acid synthase activity\n",
      "5. **Ogt** - protein O-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correct molecular functions**: The model uses appropriate molecular function terms for each protein. Notably, Mlxipl/ChREBP is correctly annotated with DNA-binding transcription activator activity (GO:0001228).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-documented evidence**: The model is supported by high-quality literature evidence, primarily from PMID:21471514, which details the role of O-GlcNAcylation in increasing ChREBP protein content and transcriptional activity in liver cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The causal relationships show how ChREBP activates downstream targets (Acaca and Fasn) in the lipid biosynthetic pathway, consistent with the literature. The model uses RO:0002407 (\"contributes to\") to connect the ChREBP transcription factor activity to its downstream targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Subcellular localization**: The model correctly places activities in their appropriate cellular compartments: transcription factors in the nucleus (GO:0005634) and metabolic enzymes in the cytosol (GO:0005829).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Integration of regulatory mechanisms**: The model shows how Ogt regulates ChREBP activity through O-GlcNAcylation, consistent with the findings in PMID:21471514.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mlx regulation of ChREBP**: The model shows Mlx (GO:0061629) directly positively regulating (RO:0002629) ChREBP (GO:0001228), but does not clearly represent the heterodimer formation. According to \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, when the activity is shared by several proteins (as in a heterodimeric transcription factor), this should be explicitly represented. Evidence in PMID:21471514 suggests ChREBP partners with Mlx to form a functional transcription factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Predicate usage**: The model uses RO:0002407 (\"contributes to\") to link ChREBP to its downstream targets, rather than the more specific \"indirectly positively regulates\" (RO:0002304) recommended in the DNA-binding transcription factor activity annotation guidelines for the relationship between a transcription factor and its target gene activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Representation of O-GlcNAcylation**: While the model correctly shows Ogt regulating ChREBP activity, the mechanism of this regulation (O-GlcNAcylation stabilizing ChREBP protein and increasing its transcriptional activity) could be represented more explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Glucose sensing mechanism**: The model represents the biological process \"positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter by glucose\" (GO:0000432), but could more clearly show how glucose levels are sensed and how this signal is transmitted to activate ChREBP.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Target gene specificity**: The model shows ChREBP regulating both Acaca and Fasn, but could benefit from including additional documented target genes to provide a more comprehensive view of the lipogenic program activated by ChREBP.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the core elements of glucose-stimulated transcriptional regulation of lipogenic genes based on the literature evidence:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **O-GlcNAcylation of ChREBP**: PMID:21471514 demonstrates that ChREBP interacts with OGT and is O-GlcNAcylated, which stabilizes the protein and increases its transcriptional activity toward glycolytic and lipogenic genes (Acaca, Fasn) when combined with an active glucose flux.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Metabolic pathway representation**: The downstream activities (acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase) correctly represent the lipid biosynthetic pathway controlled by ChREBP.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular localization**: The localization of activities is consistent with known biology - ChREBP translocates to the nucleus upon activation to regulate transcription, while the lipogenic enzymes function in the cytosol.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Refine relationship between ChREBP and Mlx**: Consider representing the Mlx-ChREBP interaction as a heterodimeric complex formation, which is required for DNA binding and transcriptional activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Update causal relationships**: Replace RO:0002407 with RO:0002304 (\"causally upstream of, positive effect\") to better reflect the indirect positive regulation between the transcription factor and its target genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expand representation of glucose sensing**: Consider adding components showing how glucose flux leads to ChREBP activation, possibly including the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway that leads to UDP-GlcNAc production and subsequent O-GlcNAcylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Include additional regulatory mechanisms**: The model could be enhanced by including phosphorylation state changes of ChREBP that affect its nuclear translocation, as described in PMID:21471514.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add more comprehensive target gene representation**: If supported by evidence, include additional documented ChREBP target genes involved in glycolysis and lipogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"gomodel:63a86a8600000805\" is a scientifically accurate representation of glucose-regulated transcription of lipogenic genes in mouse liver cells. It effectively captures the role of O-GlcNAcylation in enhancing ChREBP activity and the downstream activation of lipogenic enzymes. The model follows most GO-CAM best practices but could be improved with minor adjustments to relationship types and a more detailed representation of the Mlx-ChREBP heterodimer. Overall, this is a high-quality model that successfully communicates the biological pathway of glucose-stimulated lipogenesis through ChREBP-mediated transcriptional activation.\n",

      "- **Status**: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the pathway by which DHX16 (a DEAH-box RNA helicase) recognizes viral RNA and cooperates with RIGI (RIG-I, an innate immune receptor) to trigger antiviral immunity responses. The model depicts a signaling cascade with specific molecular functions and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Molecular Activities and Connections\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes 5 primary molecular activities across 3 proteins:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **DHX16 (UniProtKB:O60231)** has three activities:\n",
      "   - Pattern recognition receptor activity (GO:0038187)\n",
      "   - Ubiquitin binding (GO:0043130)\n",
      "   - Molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **RIGI (UniProtKB:O95786)** has one activity:\n",
      "   - Pattern recognition receptor activity (GO:0038187)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **TRIM6 (UniProtKB:Q9C030)** has one activity:\n",
      "   - Ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal connections in the model form a pathway where:\n",
      "- DHX16's pattern recognition receptor activity positively regulates its ubiquitin binding\n",
      "- DHX16's ubiquitin binding positively regulates its molecular adaptor activity\n",
      "- DHX16's molecular adaptor activity positively regulates RIGI's pattern recognition receptor activity\n",
      "- TRIM6's ubiquitin protein ligase activity positively regulates DHX16's ubiquitin binding\n",
      "\n",
      "## Cellular Context\n",
      "All activities in the model occur in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737) and are part of the antiviral innate immune response (GO:0140374).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "All the molecular functions and causal connections are supported by evidence from PMID:35263596, which is a well-conducted study published in Cell Reports in 2022. The annotations have proper evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures the findings from the primary research paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. DHX16 acts as a pattern recognition receptor by detecting specific viral RNA patterns\n",
      "2. TRIM6 creates unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains\n",
      "3. DHX16 binds these unanchored polyubiquitin chains\n",
      "4. The ubiquitin-bound DHX16 acts as a molecular adaptor to enhance RIG-I-dependent innate immune signaling\n",
      "5. This cascade leads to an effective antiviral innate immune response\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper demonstrated that DHX16's RNA helicase motif III is critical for direct interaction with specific viral RNAs, particularly those containing splicing signals from Influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Function Representation**: \n",
      "   - The model correctly uses enabling verbs (\"enabled by\") to connect gene products to molecular functions\n",
      "   - The model accurately represents roles of each protein based on evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Relationships**:\n",
      "   - The model uses appropriate causal predicates (\"directly positively regulates\") to connect activities\n",
      "   - The directional flow is logical and matches the biology\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Contexts**:\n",
      "   - Cellular context (cytoplasm) and biological process (antiviral innate immune response) are appropriately assigned\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular Adaptor Representation**:\n",
      "   - The model appropriately annotates DHX16 with molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090)\n",
      "   - This follows the guidelines from the \"Molecular adaptor activity\" document\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complex Representation**:\n",
      "   - The model doesn't explicitly represent complexes but instead focuses on the causal cascade\n",
      "   - This is appropriate as the molecular activities are assigned to individual proteins\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately captures the novel viral RNA sensing pathway discovered in the paper.\n",
      "2. The causal relationships between DHX16, TRIM6, and RIG-I are clearly represented.\n",
      "3. Each molecular function is accurately assigned to the correct protein.\n",
      "4. The model includes appropriate biological process and cellular location contexts.\n",
      "5. All connections are supported by published experimental evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well constructed, there are a few minor points that could be considered for refinement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional Context**: The model could potentially benefit from including more specific viral contexts, such as noting which viral RNAs DHX16 specifically recognizes (e.g., influenza segments 7 and 8, SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular Details**: The specific K48-linked polyubiquitin chains created by TRIM6 could be more explicitly represented, perhaps by including additional ontology terms or annotations that indicate the K48-linkage specificity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **RIG-I Downstream Activity**: The model focuses on the activation of RIG-I but doesn't extend to RIG-I's downstream effects. Considering that RIG-I activation leads to the activation of IRF3/IRF7 and IFN-β production, extending the model to include these downstream steps could provide a more complete picture of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:63a86a8600001202](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:63a86a8600001202) accurately represents the DHX16-mediated viral RNA recognition and RIG-I activation pathway as described in the research. It adheres to GO-CAM best practices and provides a clear representation of the causal relationships between molecular functions. The model effectively captures a novel mechanism of innate immune signaling in which DHX16 acts as both a pattern recognition receptor and a molecular adaptor to enhance RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by experimental evidence and represents an important contribution to our understanding of antiviral innate immune responses. With a few potential minor refinements, it serves as an excellent example of how GO-CAM can be used to represent complex biological pathways.\n",

      "## Summary of Model Content\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the non-canonical inflammasome pathway activated by caspase-11 (Casp11) binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a mouse model. The model describes a key innate immune pathway where cytosolic LPS from Gram-negative bacteria is directly recognized by caspase-11, leading to its auto-processing and activation. Activated caspase-11 then cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) to release its N-terminal domain (GSDMD-NT), which forms pores in the plasma membrane, resulting in pyroptotic cell death and the release of inflammatory cytokines.\n",

      "   - There's no explicit causal connection between NLRP3's signaling adaptor activity (GO:0035591) and other downstream events.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Add causal links to show how NLRP3 contributes to the overall inflammasome activation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Input relation clarification:**\n",
      "   - Caspase-11 lipid binding (GO:0008289) has CHEBI:58712 (lipid A(4-)) as input, which is appropriate, but the model could benefit from clearer representation of how LPS sensing leads to caspase-11 auto-processing.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Consider adding more detail about the mechanism of caspase-11 activation upon LPS binding.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Biological completeness:**\n",
      "   - The model does not include the release of IL-1β and IL-18 as final outcomes, which are important consequences of inflammasome activation.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Add these downstream effects to provide a more complete representation of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Human counterpart consideration:**\n",
      "   - Since the model focuses on mouse proteins but is potentially relevant to human biology, adding a note about human orthologs (caspase-4/5) would be valuable.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Add comments noting the human equivalents of key mouse proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Detailed Pathway Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents the following causally linked events:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Caspase-11 (MGI:MGI:107700) binds lipid A (CHEBI:58712) via lipid binding activity (GO:0008289), which occurs in the cytosol (GO:0005829).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. This leads to caspase-11's cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004197), which is properly represented as auto-processing based on the referenced literature (PMID:30135078).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Activated caspase-11 then cleaves GSDMD (MGI:MGI:1916396), which is accurately represented by a causal chain of molecular functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. GSDMD, upon cleavage, exhibits phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding (GO:0005546) and wide pore channel activity (GO:0022829) at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The model also includes NLRP3's role in inflammasome complex assembly, though this connection could be strengthened.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the non-canonical inflammasome pathway based on current literature. The model follows many GO-CAM best practices regarding evidence, causal relations, and molecular function representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main improvements needed are:\n",
      "1. Correcting the taxon inconsistency\n",
      "2. Strengthening the representation of the inflammasome complex\n",
      "3. Adding missing causal links for NLRP3's role\n",
      "4. Expanding the model to include downstream cytokine release\n",
      "\n",
      "With these adjustments, the model would provide an even more accurate and comprehensive representation of this important innate immune pathway.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:63a86a8600001865](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:63a86a8600001865)) represents the pathway by which Irgb10/Gm12250 mediates disruption of pathogen membranes, liberating bacterial ligands that are detected by inflammasomes in mouse (NCBITaxon:10090). The model shows interactions between several interferon-inducible GTPases (Gbp5, Gbp2, and Irgb10) that cooperate to disrupt pathogen membranes, leading to the release of bacterial components that activate inflammasome pathways through Aim2 and Casp4.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Structure and Components of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains six main activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gbp5 (MGI:MGI:2429943)** - G protein activity (GO:0003925) that directly positively regulates Irgb10\n",
      "2. **Gbp2 (MGI:MGI:102772)** - G protein activity (GO:0003925) that directly positively regulates Irgb10\n",
      "3. **Irgb10/Gm12250 (MGI:MGI:3649299)** - G protein activity (GO:0003925) and membrane destabilizing activity (GO:0140912)\n",
      "4. **Aim2 (MGI:MGI:2686159)** - Double-stranded DNA binding (GO:0003690), involved in AIM2 inflammasome complex assembly\n",
      "5. **Casp4 (MGI:MGI:107700)** - Lipid binding (GO:0008289), has input lipid A(4-) (CHEBI:58712)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures a clear cascade of causal relationships:\n",
      "1. Gbp5 and Gbp2 directly positively regulate (RO:0002629) Irgb10's G protein activity\n",
      "2. Irgb10's G protein activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) its own membrane destabilizing activity\n",
      "3. Irgb10's membrane destabilizing activity causally upstream, positive effect (RO:0002304) on:\n",
      "   - Aim2's double-stranded DNA binding (activating AIM2 inflammasome)\n",
      "   - Casp4's lipid binding (activating non-canonical inflammasome)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities occur in the \"symbiont cell surface\" (GO:0106139) location and are part of \"defense response to bacterium\" (GO:0042742), correctly representing the cellular location and biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Review Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures the pathway described in the literature, particularly in PMID:27693356, which demonstrates that Irgb10 is essential for activation of the DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome by disrupting bacterial membranes. The causal relationships align with the mechanism where GBPs (Gbp2 and Gbp5) target cytoplasmic bacteria, followed by Irgb10 localization to bacterial cell membranes, compromising their structural integrity and liberating bacterial ligands (DNA and LPS) that activate inflammasomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents:\n",
      "1. The hierarchical relationship where GBPs are required for Irgb10 recruitment \n",
      "2. The dual role of Irgb10 in activating both the AIM2 inflammasome (via DNA release) and caspase-11-NLRP3 inflammasome (via LPS release)\n",
      "3. The location of these activities at the symbiont cell surface\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidential support is strong, with most associations backed by direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) from PMID:27693356.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Using appropriate molecular activities**: The G protein activity (GO:0003925) and membrane destabilizing activity (GO:0140912) correctly represent the molecular functions of these proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal predicates:\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for direct regulatory relationships\n",
      "   - RO:0002304 (causally upstream of, positive effect) for the downstream effects on inflammasome activation\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Context information**: Each activity is correctly placed in cellular context (symbiont cell surface) and biological process context (defense response to bacterium).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence**: Every association has appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is biologically accurate and well-structured, there are a few areas that could be enhanced:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Membrane Destabilizing Mechanism**: The model could potentially elaborate on the specific mechanism of Irgb10's membrane destabilizing activity. PMID:33469160 describes the molecular basis of IRGB10 oligomerization and membrane association, which could be incorporated to provide more mechanistic detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Inflammasome Assembly**: The model shows the binding activities (DNA binding by Aim2, LPS binding by Casp4) but doesn't fully capture the subsequent inflammasome assembly. It might be beneficial to extend the model to show how these binding events lead to complete inflammasome formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evolutionary Context**: The model focuses on mouse proteins, but it could be noted that the IRG family has undergone significant evolutionary changes, with humans having fewer functional IRG genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:63a86a8600001865 is a high-quality representation of how Irgb10/Gm12250 mediates disruption of pathogen membranes to activate inflammasome pathways. It accurately captures the cascade of molecular activities involved in this immune defense mechanism, with proper causal relationships and contextual information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with current literature on Irgb10 function, particularly regarding its role in disrupting bacterial membranes to liberate ligands for inflammasome activation. It follows GO-CAM best practices and provides a clear picture of this important innate immune pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strengths of this model are its biological accuracy, appropriate use of causal relationships, and strong evidential support. The inclusion of both G protein activity and membrane destabilizing activity for Irgb10 correctly captures its dual functional roles in pathogen membrane disruption.\n",

      "### Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model captures the AIM2 inflammasome pathway in humans, which plays a critical role in innate immune responses by detecting cytosolic double-stranded DNA, leading to inflammation and pyroptotic cell death. The model represents the sequential activities and causal relationships between the key proteins involved in this pathway: AIM2, PYCARD/ASC, Caspase-1 (CASP1), and Gasdermin-D (GSDMD).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Components and Pathway Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initiating Event**: AIM2 (UniProtKB:O14862) senses cytosolic double-stranded DNA through its:\n",
      "   - Double-stranded DNA binding activity (GO:0003690)\n",
      "   - Pattern recognition receptor activity (GO:0038187)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Inflammasome Assembly**: AIM2 recruits PYCARD/ASC through:\n",
      "   - Signaling adaptor activity (GO:0035591)\n",
      "   - PYCARD then activates CASP1 through cysteine-type endopeptidase activator activity (GO:0140608)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Caspase Activation**: CASP1 (UniProtKB:P29466) becomes active through:\n",
      "   - Cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004197)\n",
      "   - Leads to protein maturation processes (GO:0051604)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Effector Functions**: GSDMD (UniProtKB:P57764) mediates:\n",
      "   - Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding (GO:0005546)\n",
      "   - Wide pore channel activity (GO:0022829)\n",
      "   - Positive regulation of inflammatory response (GO:0050729)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive Pathway Coverage**: The model captures the entire sequence from DNA sensing to inflammasome formation, caspase activation, and pyroptosis induction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Causal Relationships**: The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) to indicate the direct activation relationships between the pathway components.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subcellular Localization**: Appropriate subcellular locations are included for each activity (e.g., cytoplasm for AIM2, plasma membrane for GSDMD).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence Quality**: Each assertion is supported by high-quality experimental evidence (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) with appropriate literature citations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Potential Intermediates**: The model does not capture potential intermediate steps between GSDMD binding phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and its pore-forming activity. Recent research indicates that GSDMD undergoes palmitoylation at Cys-191 (as shown in UniProtKB:P57764), which is essential for its membrane targeting and pore formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cleavage Events Not Explicitly Modeled**: The proteolytic cleavage of GSDMD by CASP1 at Asp-275 to release the N-terminal fragment is implied but not explicitly captured. This is a critical event for pyroptosis induction.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Final Outcomes**: While the model shows GSDMD pore formation, it doesn't explicitly capture downstream consequences such as IL-1β/IL-18 release or cell lysis through NINJ1 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex Formation Representation**: The AIM2 inflammasome complex assembly (GO:0140970) is indicated as part of the process, but the model does not explicitly show the oligomerization of these components into the inflammasome speck, which is a key structural feature of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal Association Predicates**: The model appropriately uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) throughout to indicate direct positive regulation between sequential steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular Function Representation**: Each activity is correctly represented as a molecular function enabled by the appropriate gene product.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Process Association**: Each activity is appropriately located within the relevant biological process, such as AIM2 inflammasome complex assembly (GO:0140970) or positive regulation of inflammatory response (GO:0050729).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence and Provenance**: Each assertion is properly supported with evidence codes, literature references, and contribution statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add GSDMD Cleavage**: Explicitly model the CASP1-mediated cleavage of GSDMD at Asp-275, releasing the N-terminal domain that forms pores.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include GSDMD Palmitoylation**: Recent research (UniProtKB:P57764, references 37-39) shows that palmitoylation at Cys-191 is critical for GSDMD function. This post-translational modification could be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Capture Downstream Consequences**: Expand the model to include the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18) through the GSDMD pores and subsequent events leading to pyroptotic cell death.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Represent Inflammasome Speck Formation**: AIM2 and PYCARD form distinct filamentous structures in the inflammasome speck, which could be explicitly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Include Potential Regulatory Mechanisms**: Consider including negative regulatory mechanisms such as succination of GSDMD at cysteine residues, which can inactivate GSDMD and block pyroptosis (UniProtKB:P57764, reference 24).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a solid foundation for representing the AIM2 inflammasome pathway. It correctly captures the key molecular activities and causal relationships in the pathway, from DNA sensing to pore formation. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices regarding evidence standards and relationship types.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further enhance its biological completeness, the model could be expanded to include recent discoveries about protein modifications, complex formation details, and downstream consequences of inflammasome activation. These additions would provide a more comprehensive representation of this important innate immune pathway.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model (ID: [gomodel:63c0ac2b00000088](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:63c0ac2b00000088)) represents the AIM2 inflammasome pathway in mouse. The model depicts how the AIM2 sensor recognizes cytosolic double-stranded DNA, which leads to the activation of a signaling cascade resulting in pyroptotic inflammatory cell death.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Overview\n",
      "The model correctly captures the sequential activation steps of the AIM2 inflammasome:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. AIM2 (MGI:MGI:2686159) acts as a pattern recognition receptor, binding to cytosolic double-stranded DNA (GO:0003690)\n",
      "2. Upon activation, AIM2 recruits the adaptor protein ASC/PYCARD\n",
      "3. This complex activates Caspase-1 (Casp1, MGI:MGI:96544)\n",
      "4. Caspase-1 cleaves Gasdermin-D (Gsdmd, MGI:MGI:1916396), which translocates to the plasma membrane\n",
      "5. Gasdermin-D forms pores in the membrane (GO:0022829), leading to cell death through pyroptosis and release of inflammatory mediators\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model correctly represents the key molecular functions of the AIM2 inflammasome components:\n",
      "   - AIM2's double-stranded DNA binding (GO:0003690)\n",
      "   - AIM2's pattern recognition receptor activity (GO:0038187)\n",
      "   - AIM2's signaling adaptor activity (GO:0035591)\n",
      "   - Caspase-1's cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004197)\n",
      "   - Gasdermin-D's phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding (GO:0005546)\n",
      "   - Gasdermin-D's wide pore channel activity (GO:0022829)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The cellular locations are accurately represented:\n",
      "   - AIM2 functions in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - Gasdermin-D acts at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The model correctly uses causal connections (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\") to represent the signaling cascade, showing how each protein's activity positively regulates the next step.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The biological processes are appropriately annotated:\n",
      "   - AIM2 inflammasome complex assembly (GO:0140970)\n",
      "   - Protein maturation (GO:0051604)\n",
      "   - Positive regulation of inflammatory response (GO:0050729)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Evidence codes and literature references are appropriately cited throughout the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Potential Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: According to GO-CAM guidelines on complex annotation, the AIM2 inflammasome itself could be better represented. The model correctly shows individual proteins and their activities, but it doesn't explicitly represent the formation of the AIM2-ASC-caspase-1 complex. While this is implied through the causal relationships, it might be beneficial to explicitly represent the complex using a GO term for the AIM2 inflammasome complex (GO:0097169).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Intermediate Steps**: The model doesn't explicitly show the ASC/PYCARD protein, which is a critical adapter between AIM2 and caspase-1. While the activity flow is correct, the omission of this component might make the model less complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **IL-1β Release**: The end result of AIM2 inflammasome activation includes the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18, which is not represented in this model. Although the model correctly focuses on the pyroptotic pathway through Gasdermin-D, the parallel inflammatory cytokine release pathway is an important part of inflammasome biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Feedback Mechanisms**: The model doesn't include any regulatory or feedback mechanisms that might control inflammasome activation. Recent literature shows that AIM2 inflammasome activity is tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Literature Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well supported by the literature, including key references:\n",
      "- PMID:19158679 describing AIM2 as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor for the inflammasome\n",
      "- PMID:32109412 documenting caspase-1's role in pyroptosis\n",
      "- PMID:27383986 explaining Gasdermin-D's role in forming membrane pores\n",
      "\n",
      "These references correctly support the molecular functions and biological processes represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical QC\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Predicate Usage**: The model appropriately uses RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\" for causal relationships between activities, which is consistent with GO-CAM guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence**: Each assertion is backed by appropriate evidence codes (primarily ECO:0000314 \"direct assay evidence used in manual assertion\" and ECO:0000250 \"sequence similarity evidence used in manual assertion\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Annotations**: All GO term annotations appear to be correctly applied to the appropriate proteins and activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a high-quality GO-CAM model that accurately represents the AIM2 inflammasome pathway leading to pyroptosis. The model is well-supported by scientific literature and follows GO-CAM annotation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations for enhancement:\n",
      "1. Consider explicitly representing the ASC/PYCARD adapter protein to complete the canonical inflammasome complex.\n",
      "2. Consider adding the parallel pathway leading to IL-1β maturation and release.\n",
      "3. Add the AIM2 inflammasome complex term (GO:0097169) to better represent the complex formation.\n",

      "- **Taxon**: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)\n",
      "- **Status**: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents how IRGM (Immunity-related GTPase family M protein) coordinates the core autophagy machinery to conduct antimicrobial defense in humans. The model describes several key activities and causal associations between IRGM, PRKAA1 (AMPK), ULK1, and BECN1 (Beclin-1).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Detailed Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures the key molecular interactions described in the literature, particularly from the Chauhan et al. (2015) paper (PMID:25891078). This paper establishes IRGM as a central regulator that directly assembles autophagy machinery by interacting with ULK1 and Beclin-1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow in the model correctly shows:\n",
      "- IRGM's G protein activity (GO:0003925) directly positively regulates its protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity (GO:0043539)\n",
      "- IRGM's protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674) directly positively regulates ULK1's protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "- IRGM's protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity directly positively regulates PRKAA1's protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "- PRKAA1's kinase activity directly positively regulates ULK1's kinase activity\n",
      "- ULK1's kinase activity directly positively regulates BECN1's protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674)\n",
      "\n",
      "These relationships accurately reflect the findings from the paper that IRGM interacts with ULK1 and Beclin-1, promotes their co-assembly, and governs the formation of autophagy initiation complexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. GO-CAM Best Practices Review\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Proper use of causal relationships**: The model uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) appropriately to show direct regulatory relationships between the molecular activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Biological context**: All activities are properly placed in relevant biological processes:\n",
      "  - IRGM's activities are part of defense response to bacterium (GO:0042742)\n",
      "  - PRKAA1's kinase activity is part of positive regulation of autophagy (GO:0010508)\n",
      "  - ULK1's kinase activity occurs in the autophagosome (GO:0005776) and is part of autophagosome assembly (GO:0000045)\n",
      "  - BECN1's adaptor activity is in the autophagosome and part of protein-containing complex assembly (GO:0065003)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Cellular components**: Where relevant, activities are properly located in cellular components (e.g., ULK1 and BECN1 activities occurring in the autophagosome).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model generally follows best practices, there are a few areas that could be improved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing evidence codes for some assertions**: All causal associations and molecular function assertions use ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) with appropriate PMIDs, which is good. However, there's one cellular location assertion (BECN1 in autophagosome) that uses ECO:0000250 (sequence similarity evidence) with a mouse gene (MGI:1891828) as reference. Given the importance of this localization, it would be better to find direct human evidence if available.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex representation**: The model doesn't explicitly represent the ULK1-BECN1 complex that forms as a result of IRGM activity. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, when the subunits and their activities are known (as in this case), representing the individual proteins is appropriate. However, since the paper emphasizes the importance of the complex formation itself, it might be useful to consider adding the complex representation for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness**: The paper mentions additional interactions, such as with ATG16L1, that aren't represented in the model. While models don't need to represent everything, this additional interaction could enhance the completeness of the pathway representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process context**: While the model correctly places IRGM activities in the \"defense response to bacterium\" process, the paper also mentions its role in controlling inflammation. Adding this context might provide a more complete picture of IRGM's functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:63c0ac2b00000267 is a high-quality representation of how IRGM governs the core autophagy machinery to conduct antimicrobial defense. It accurately captures the key molecular activities and causal relationships established in the literature, particularly from Chauhan et al. (2015). The model follows GO-CAM best practices in terms of causal relationships, biological context, and cellular components.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be enhanced with more direct human evidence for certain assertions, possibly by representing the ULK1-BECN1 complex explicitly, and by including additional interactions such as with ATG16L1. Overall, however, the model provides a clear and accurate representation of this important biological pathway.\n",

      "The model accurately represents the findings from the key publication (PMID:35793002) where Zika virus NS3 protein is shown to bind CEP63, leading to centrosome disorganization and suppression of innate immune response via TBK1 degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key findings from the paper that are represented in the model:\n",
      "- Zika virus NS3 binds to CEP63 (and this is correctly modeled)\n",
      "- This interaction leads to recruitment of DTX4 (a ubiquitin ligase) to the centrosome\n",
      "- DTX4 promotes K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1, leading to its degradation\n",

      "### GO-CAM Best Practices Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "1. **Molecular activities are properly annotated:**\n",
      "   - Each protein has an appropriate molecular function (MF) term assigned\n",
      "   - Cellular components (occurs_in) and biological processes (part_of) are appropriately assigned\n",

      "   - The model correctly shows the cascade of events from viral protein to immune suppression\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complex handling:**\n",
      "   - The model correctly follows the recommendations in the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document by representing the specific proteins with known activities rather than using a generic complex term\n",
      "\n",
      "**Minor observation:**\n",
      "- The model shows there was an automated change made on 2023-03-16 replacing RO:0002212 with RO:0002630 and RO:0002213 with RO:0002629, which is consistent with best practices to use more specific relationship types\n",

      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"63c0ac2b00000464\" accurately represents the mechanism by which Zika virus NS3 protein disrupts the innate immune response through CEP63 binding and centrosome disorganization, leading to TBK1 degradation. The model follows GO-CAM best practices and is well-supported by experimental evidence.\n",

      "## Components and Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four activities (molecular function associations):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SKP1** (UniProtKB:P63208) enables molecular function activator activity (GO:0140677)\n",
      "2. **FBXO45** (UniProtKB:P0C2W1) enables ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity (GO:1990756)\n",

      "\n",
      "- SKP1 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) FBXO45\n",
      "- FBXO45 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) MYCBP2\n",
      "- MYCBP2 directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) NMNAT2\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Component Information\n",
      "\n",
      "- SKP1, FBXO45, and MYCBP2 occur in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "- NMNAT2 occurs in the Golgi apparatus (GO:0005794)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Process Context\n",
      "\n",
      "- SKP1, FBXO45, and MYCBP2 are part of protein K48-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070936)\n",
      "- NMNAT2 is part of axon development (GO:0061564)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Review Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the biological relationship described in the literature (PMID:29997255) where the PAM/FBXO45/SKP1 complex ubiquitinates NMNAT2, targeting it for degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The model correctly follows GO-CAM best practices for representing E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes as outlined in the \"E3_ubiquitin_ligases\" document, with:\n",
      "   - SKP1 as a molecular function activator (scaffold component)\n",
      "   - FBXO45 as a ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor\n",
      "   - MYCBP2 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase\n",
      "   - NMNAT2 as the substrate\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The causal relationships are appropriately represented, showing the flow of activity from SKP1 to FBXO45 to MYCBP2, which then negatively regulates NMNAT2.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The biological process of protein K48-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070936) is correctly assigned to the components of the ubiquitin ligase complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Cellular components are appropriately annotated for each protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence Codes and References**: The evidence for SKP1's molecular function activator activity appears to be citing the same reference (PMID:29997255) twice. This redundancy could be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expanded Biological Process Context**: While NMNAT2 is correctly annotated as being part of axon development, the model could benefit from connecting the protein K48-linked ubiquitination process to a higher-level biological process such as \"axon maintenance\" or \"regulation of axon degeneration\" to better capture the functional impact of NMNAT2 degradation, as described in the literature where NMNAT2 acts as an axon maintenance factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Information**: Consider adding information about the molecular mechanisms through which MYCBP2 specifically targets threonine/serine residues for ubiquitination, as described in its UniProt entry (O75592), which mentions its atypical activity targeting threonine instead of lysine residues.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the non-canonical nature of the PAM/FBXO45/SKP1 complex as described in the literature. Unlike typical SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complexes that include CUL1, this complex contains MYCBP2 (PAM) instead of CUL1. The model correctly depicts FBXO45 as having dual roles in substrate recognition and complex assembly, and SKP1 as an auxiliary component.\n",
      "\n",
      "The representation of NMNAT2 as a substrate of this complex aligns with the published research showing that this interaction leads to NMNAT2 polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, which has implications for axon maintenance and degeneration.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model demonstrates good adherence to GO-CAM guidelines for representing E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. The predicate relationships use the appropriate relation terms (RO:0002629 for \"directly positively regulates\" and RO:0002630 for \"directly negatively regulates\").\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the biological process of NMNAT2 ubiquitination and degradation via the atypical PAM/FBXO45/SKP1 E3 ligase complex. The model aligns with current literature and follows GO-CAM best practices for representing ubiquitination processes. The minor suggestions for improvement would enhance the model's biological context but do not detract from its current quality and accuracy.\n",

      "## Evaluation of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy:** The model accurately captures a host-pathogen interaction based on recent literature (PMID:36593296). The study demonstrates that S. aureus HlgB targets AMFR to regulate TAB3 ubiquitination, promoting TAK1 activation and subsequent NF-kappa-B signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper annotation of complexes:** The model follows the GO-CAM guidelines for annotating complexes by using the specific proteins that carry known molecular activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate use of molecular function terms:** Each protein has been assigned appropriate molecular function terms based on their known activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal relationships:** The model correctly uses the \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) predicate to show the causal chain from HlgB to NF-kappa-B signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Proper cellular location annotation:** Each activity is appropriately annotated with the cellular location where it occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues/Improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incomplete description of HlgB's function:** While HlgB is annotated with \"molecular adaptor activity,\" the literature (PMID:36593296) suggests it may also have a role in binding to AMFR directly. The model could be expanded to better capture this interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular adaptor activity of TAB3:** According to literature, TAB3 is known to be ubiquitinated by AMFR through K27-linked polyubiquitination at Lysine 649, which then promotes TAK1/MAP3K7 activation. The model correctly shows TAB3 as a molecular adaptor, but the specific mechanism of how it adapts/connects TAK1 could be made clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological process annotation:** MAP3K7 is annotated as part of \"canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction\" while TAB3 is part of \"non-canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction\" - this seems inconsistent, as they are participating in the same signaling pathway in this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing connection to downstream effects:** The model could be expanded to show the downstream effects of MAP3K7 activation on NF-kappa-B activation and subsequent inflammatory responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clarify the biological process consistency:** Review whether TAB3 and MAP3K7 should both be annotated with the same biological process term, as they appear to be part of the same signaling pathway in this context.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expand the role of HlgB:** Consider adding more detail about how HlgB interacts with AMFR, perhaps specifying a protein binding activity in addition to its adaptor role.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add details about TAB3 ubiquitination:** While the causal relationship between AMFR and TAB3 is captured, the model could explicitly note that this involves K27-linked polyubiquitination of TAB3 at Lys-649.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Extend the pathway downstream:** Consider extending the model to include downstream components of the NF-kappa-B pathway to provide a more complete picture of the inflammatory response.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add additional literature support:** While the key references are included, adding more supporting literature could strengthen the evidence base for the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:63c0ac2b00000547) successfully captures a host-pathogen interaction between S. aureus HlgB and the human AMFR-TAB3-MAP3K7 signaling axis, leading to NF-kappa-B activation. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices for activity annotation, causal relationships, and cellular context. With some minor improvements in consistency and completeness, this model could provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important inflammatory pathway triggered by S. aureus infection.\n",

The model depicts a series of molecular functions and causal relationships centered on how AIM2 (Absent in melanoma 2) acts as a cytosolic DNA sensor that triggers the assembly of the inflammasome, eventually leading to pyroptotic inflammatory response.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following key components:\n",
      "1. AIM2 (MGI:MGI:2686159) detection of DNA damage\n",
      "2. Caspase-1 (MGI:MGI:96544) activation\n",

      "## Detailed Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scientific Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current scientific understanding of AIM2 inflammasome activation as supported by the literature. Key findings from references such as PMID:27846608 and PMID:27383986 align with the model structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. AIM2 serves as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor that detects double-stranded DNA damage at sites of double-strand breaks.\n",
      "2. Upon DNA binding, AIM2 activates the inflammasome through a signaling adaptor activity.\n",
      "3. This leads to activation of caspase-1, which cleaves pro-IL-1β and GSDMD.\n",
      "4. Cleaved GSDMD forms pores in the plasma membrane, resulting in pyroptotic cell death.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow of activities in the model correctly represents the biological pathway as described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Structure Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model demonstrates a coherent structure with appropriate causal relationships between activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **DNA Binding and Recognition**:\n",
      "   - AIM2 \"double-stranded DNA binding\" (GO:0003690) occurs in the \"site of double-strand break\" (GO:0035861)\n",
      "   - AIM2 \"pattern recognition receptor activity\" (GO:0038187) is correctly shown as directly positively regulating the next step\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Inflammasome Activation**:\n",
      "   - AIM2 \"signaling adaptor activity\" (GO:0035591) is present, consistent with its known role\n",
      "   - AIM2's \"cysteine-type endopeptidase activator activity\" (GO:0140608) correctly shows it activates caspase-1\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Caspase-1 Activation**:\n",
      "   - Caspase-1 \"cysteine-type endopeptidase activity\" (GO:0004197) is shown as part of \"protein maturation\" (GO:0051604)\n",
      "   - Caspase-1 is shown activating GSDMD, which is consistent with the literature\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **GSDMD Pore Formation**:\n",
      "   - GSDMD \"phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding\" (GO:0005546) occurs at the \"plasma membrane\" (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - GSDMD \"wide pore channel activity\" (GO:0022829) is shown as part of \"positive regulation of inflammatory response\" (GO:0050729)\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally adheres to GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use of correct causal relations**: The model uses \"RO:0002629\" (directly positively regulates) appropriately to connect sequential activities in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular function assignments**: Each protein has been assigned appropriate molecular functions based on experimental evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular component annotations**: Activities are correctly localized to appropriate cellular components (e.g., AIM2 DNA binding at sites of double-strand breaks, GSDMD pore formation at the plasma membrane).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process annotations**: Each activity is associated with appropriate biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence codes**: The model uses ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) and ECO:0000250 (sequence similarity evidence used in manual assertion) appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, there are a few areas that could be improved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Taxon inconsistency**: The title refers to mouse (\"Mouse\"), but the taxon is listed as human (NCBITaxon:9606). This should be corrected for consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pycard/ASC representation**: The model mentions \"MGI:MGI:1931465\" (Pycard/ASC) in the objects list but does not include it in the pathway. Since ASC is a crucial adaptor for the AIM2 inflammasome, it would be beneficial to explicitly show its role in connecting AIM2 to caspase-1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **IL-1β processing**: While the model shows the activation of the inflammasome machinery, it could be enhanced by including the processing and release of IL-1β, which is a major functional outcome of inflammasome activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex formation**: According to the GO-CAM best practices for annotating complexes, the AIM2 inflammasome complex could be more explicitly modeled. Since the model focuses on the AIM2 inflammasome, it would be beneficial to either explicitly show the complex formation or follow the guidelines for representing complexes in GO-CAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Activation of the AIM2 inflammasome in response to DNA damage\" (gomodel:63d320cd00000225) is a well-constructed representation of the AIM2 inflammasome pathway. It accurately captures the scientific understanding of how DNA damage activates the AIM2 inflammasome, leading to caspase-1 activation, GSDMD pore formation, and subsequent inflammatory response.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for most aspects, with appropriate molecular functions, cellular components, biological processes, and causal relationships. The evidence provided is appropriate and linked to relevant literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further enhance this model, I recommend:\n",
      "1. Resolving the taxon inconsistency (mouse vs. human)\n",
      "2. Explicitly including ASC/Pycard in the pathway\n",
      "3. Adding the processing and release of IL-1β\n",
      "4. Considering a more explicit representation of the AIM2 inflammasome complex according to GO-CAM best practices for complex annotation\n",

      "1. **Complex representation**: The model doesn't explicitly represent the AIM2 inflammasome complex (GO:0140970). Based on the GO-CAM guidelines for complex annotation, when multiple proteins are involved in a complex and the specific activity of each is known, it's preferable to represent each protein's specific contribution. The current model does show individual proteins and their activities, but doesn't explicitly indicate that they form part of the AIM2 inflammasome complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing components**: The model does not include the ASC/PYCARD adaptor protein (MGI:MGI:1931465), which is a crucial component of the AIM2 inflammasome. According to the literature (PMID:27383986), AIM2 recruits ASC, which then recruits caspase-1. This intermediate step is missing in the current model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing IL-1β processing**: A key outcome of inflammasome activation is the processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, which is not represented in this model. However, the model does focus on the pyroptotic cell death aspect, which is another important outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological context**: The model could benefit from more explicit connections to neurodevelopment processes, which are mentioned in the title but not explicitly modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Include ASC/PYCARD**: Add the ASC adaptor protein (MGI:MGI:1931465) and its interaction with both AIM2 and caspase-1 to better reflect the complete inflammasome assembly process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add AIM2 inflammasome complex**: Consider explicitly annotating the formation of the AIM2 inflammasome complex (GO:0140970) to better represent the molecular mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Extend to cytokine processing**: If appropriate for the scope of the model, include the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, which is another important consequence of inflammasome activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connect to neurodevelopment**: Add activities or biological processes that explicitly connect inflammasome activation to neurodevelopment, such as neural cell death or specific neurodevelopmental processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Additional evidence**: Consider including more recent evidence supporting the role of AIM2 in neural development to strengthen the model's scientific basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model 63d320cd00000317 provides a scientifically accurate representation of AIM2 inflammasome activation leading to pyroptosis in neural cells. The model is well-structured with appropriate causal connections and is supported by evidence from the literature. With the suggested improvements, particularly the addition of the ASC adaptor protein and explicit representation of the inflammasome complex, the model would more comprehensively represent the current understanding of this pathway and its role in neurodevelopment.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes the mechanism by which Ifi202 (p202) negatively regulates the AIM2 inflammasome in mice. The model captures the molecular interactions between Ifi202 and Aim2, and how these interactions prevent AIM2 inflammasome complex assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Components and Molecular Activities\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes five key molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ifi202a double-stranded DNA binding activity** (GO:0003690) enabled by Ifi202a (MGI:MGI:1347080)\n",
      "   - Part of negative regulation of AIM2 inflammasome complex assembly (GO:0140972)\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Ifi202a molecular adaptor activity** (GO:0060090) enabled by Ifi202a (MGI:MGI:1347080)\n",
      "   - Part of negative regulation of AIM2 inflammasome complex assembly (GO:0140972)\n",
      "   - Causally upstream of (negatively regulates) Aim2's signaling adaptor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Aim2 double-stranded DNA binding activity** (GO:0003690) enabled by Aim2 (MGI:MGI:2686159)\n",
      "   - Occurs in cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - Part of AIM2 inflammasome complex assembly (GO:0140970)\n",
      "   - Causally upstream of (positively regulates) Aim2's pattern recognition receptor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Aim2 pattern recognition receptor activity** (GO:0038187) enabled by Aim2 (MGI:MGI:2686159)\n",

      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is supported by several published studies, primarily:\n",
      "- PMID:23850291 - Primary reference describing the molecular mechanism of p202-mediated inhibition of AIM2 inflammasome\n",
      "- PMID:23567559 - Describes the structural basis for termination of AIM2-mediated signaling by p202\n",
      "- PMID:19158679 - Provides evidence for cytoplasmic localization of the AIM2 inflammasome complex\n",
      "\n",
      "## Review Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular mechanism representation**: The model accurately represents the key findings from the literature showing that Ifi202a (p202) inhibits AIM2 inflammasome assembly through two complementary mechanisms:\n",
      "   - Direct binding to double-stranded DNA (competing with AIM2)\n",
      "   - Direct interaction with AIM2 via its HIN domain, which prevents proper clustering of AIM2 and recruitment of ASC\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular localization**: The model correctly indicates that AIM2 inflammasome assembly occurs in the cytoplasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**: The causal relationships in the model correctly show how Ifi202a activities negatively regulate AIM2 activities, preventing inflammasome assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity representation**: The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "   - Appropriately representing the molecular functions of both proteins\n",
      "   - Connecting activities with causal relationships (RO:0002630 \"directly negatively regulates\" and RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\")\n",
      "   - Including proper cellular locations\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex annotation**: The model follows the recommendations from the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document. Since the activities of specific subunits (Ifi202a and Aim2) are known, the activities are represented by the specific proteins carrying the activities rather than using a complex ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence coding**: Each activity and relationship is properly supported with evidence codes (ECO:0000314 \"direct assay evidence used in manual assertion\") and appropriate PMID references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional context**: The model could potentially include more context about the downstream effects of AIM2 inflammasome inhibition, such as reduced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β/IL-18 processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **ASC recruitment**: The model does not explicitly represent the recruitment of ASC (PYCARD/Asc) to the AIM2 inflammasome, which is a key step in inflammasome assembly and is blocked by Ifi202a. Including this would provide a more complete picture of the mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tetrameric structure of Ifi202a**: The model doesn't capture the tetrameric structure of Ifi202a that was highlighted in PMID:23850291 as important for its function in inhibiting AIM2. This structural feature enhances its ability to bind DNA with higher affinity than AIM2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model 63d320cd00000399 accurately represents the current scientific understanding of how Ifi202a negatively regulates AIM2 inflammasome assembly in mice. It captures the key molecular activities and their causal relationships based on published evidence. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for complex annotation and causality representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively illustrates an important species-specific regulatory mechanism, as p202 is present in mice but not humans, providing insight into different inflammatory response regulation between species.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are a few areas where additional context could enhance the model, overall it represents a high-quality GO-CAM model of this important regulatory pathway.\n",

      "### Overview of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes a translation quality control pathway that detects and responds to stalled ribosomes in human cells. The model focuses on how GCN1 (stalled ribosome sensor), RNF14, and RNF25 (E3 ubiquitin ligases) work together to ubiquitinate and degrade the translation elongation factor EEF1A1 in response to ribosome stalling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Main Components and Activities\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GCN1 (Q92616)** - Acts as a stalled ribosome sensor with \"stalled ribosome sensor activity\" (GO:0170011)\n",

      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships in the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows the following causal relationships:\n",
      "- GCN1 positively regulates RNF14 (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\")\n",

      "- RNF14 negatively regulates EEF1A1 (RO:0002630 \"directly negatively regulates\")\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence and Annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "All annotations in the model are supported by experimental evidence from the same primary research article:\n",
      "- Evidence code: ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- Reference: PMID:36638793\n",
      "- All annotations date from February 2023\n",
      "- Curator: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7299-6685\n",
      "\n",
      "### Assessment of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate Molecular Function Annotations**: All proteins have correctly assigned molecular functions based on their known activities:\n",
      "   - GCN1 as a stalled ribosome sensor\n",
      "   - RNF14 and RNF25 as E3 ubiquitin ligases\n",
      "   - EEF1A1 as a translation elongation factor\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Locations**: The activities are correctly annotated to occur in the cytosolic ribosome, which is consistent with the ribosome stalling response pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clear Biological Processes**: Each protein is appropriately associated with its relevant biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Correct Causal Relationships**: The model captures key regulatory relationships between the components:\n",
      "   - GCN1 as the sensor activating RNF14\n",
      "   - RNF25 working with RNF14\n",
      "   - RNF14 directly negatively regulating EEF1A1 through ubiquitination\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Sound Evidence**: All annotations are backed by direct experimental evidence from the same study.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Areas for Consideration:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Specificity of RNF14 Activity**: The model correctly shows that RNF14 directly ubiquitinates EEF1A1, targeting Lysine 385 (K385) as shown in the paper. However, this specific detail about K385 being the primary ubiquitination target could be made more explicit in the annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Role of RPS27A**: The paper indicates that RNF25 specifically ubiquitinates RPS27A at Lysine 113 (K113), which is an essential step for the subsequent RNF14-mediated EEF1A1 ubiquitination. This detail is missing from the current model and could be included to make the pathway more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Temporal Sequence**: While the causal relationships capture the regulatory direction, the model doesn't fully convey the temporal sequence described in the paper: RNF25 first ubiquitinates RPS27A, which then allows GCN1-bound RNF14 to ubiquitinate EEF1A1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Representation of Stalled Ribosomes**: The model implicitly addresses ribosome stalling through the process annotations, but doesn't explicitly show what constitutes a \"stalled ribosome\" (e.g., the presence of ternatin-4 as a stalling agent mentioned in the paper).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Include RPS27A in the Model**: Add RPS27A (ribosomal protein S27a) as a component, showing its ubiquitination by RNF25 at K113 as an essential step in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Specify Ubiquitination Sites**: Consider adding annotations that specify the key ubiquitination sites (K385 on EEF1A1 and K113 on RPS27A) to provide more mechanistic detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clarify the Temporal Sequence**: The model could be structured to better reflect the temporal sequence of events: ribosome stalling → GCN1 sensing → RNF25 ubiquitinating RPS27A → RNF14 binding to GCN1 → RNF14 ubiquitinating EEF1A1 → EEF1A1 degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Adding Proteasomal Degradation**: The final degradation of ubiquitinated EEF1A1 by the proteasome could be included to complete the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the key components and regulatory relationships involved in the response to ribosome stalling leading to EEF1A1 ubiquitination and degradation. The model is well-supported by evidence and follows good curation practices. With the suggested additions, particularly the inclusion of RPS27A and more explicit representation of the temporal sequence, the model would provide an even more comprehensive view of this important translation quality control pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model conforms well to GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities and their causal relationships. The use of appropriate protein instances, molecular functions, cellular locations, and biological processes adheres to the guidelines for GO-CAM modeling.\n",

      "2. **Appropriate GO terms**: The molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes are accurately assigned to each gene product.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence-based**: All causal relationships are supported by experimental evidence from peer-reviewed publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate relationship predicates:\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Additional molecular details**: The model does not explicitly represent:\n",
      "   - The phosphorylation of SUI2/eIF2α by GCN2\n",
      "   - The ubiquitination activity of HEL2 on ribosomal proteins\n",

      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:63e5937500000106 is a well-constructed representation of the antagonistic relationship between the HEL2-mediated ribosome quality control pathway and the GCN2-mediated integrated stress response in yeast.

The model successfully captures how the cell balances two distinct responses to ribosome collisions - the RQC pathway mediated by HEL2 and the ISR pathway mediated by GCN2.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the No-Go decay (NGD) pathway in yeast, focusing on a specific mechanism where HEL2-mediated ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins triggers a quality control process that ultimately leads to degradation of problematic mRNAs. The model captures a series of molecular events from the initial sensing of ribosome collisions by HEL2, to the ubiquitination of RPS7/eS7, recruitment of the endonuclease CUE2, and subsequent mRNA degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Entities and Activities in the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes five main activities, each associated with specific gene products:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **HEL2/SGD:S000002674** performing two functions:\n",

      "   - Ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Ribosomal proteins RPS7A (SGD:S000005622) and RPS7B (SGD:S000005040)** which are targets of ubiquitination\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Processes Represented\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures several key biological processes:\n",
      "- Nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, no-go decay (GO:0070966)\n",
      "- Rescue of stalled ribosome (GO:0072344)\n",

      "- Protein monoubiquitination (GO:0006513)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes causal links between activities:\n",
      "1. HEL2's stalled ribosome sensor activity directly positively regulates MOT2's ubiquitin ligase activity (RO:0002629)\n",
      "2. HEL2's ubiquitin ligase activity directly positively regulates CUE2's K63-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding (RO:0002629)\n",

      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by experimental evidence from multiple peer-reviewed publications:\n",
      "- PMID:30609991 (Ikeuchi et al.)\n",
      "- PMID:32615089 (Meydan and Guydosh)\n",
      "- PMID:31219035 (D'Orazio et al.)\n",
      "- PMID:36583309 (Noguchi et al.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each activity is supported by direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) or author statements supported by traceable references (ECO:0000304).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Control Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Biological Accuracy**: The model accurately represents the current understanding of the No-Go decay pathway in yeast, specifically capturing the roles of HEL2, CUE2, and MOT2 in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidential Support**: All activities and connections are supported by appropriate experimental evidence from peer-reviewed literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular Detail**: The model provides good molecular resolution, clearly indicating specific ubiquitination events (K63-linked) and the sequential nature of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Context**: All activities are properly annotated with their cellular location (cytosolic ribosome, GO:0022626).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Causal Relationships**: The model effectively uses causal relationships to show how one activity leads to another, creating a coherent biological pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices:\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "- Using appropriate causality relations between activities\n",
      "- Including cellular locations for activities\n",
      "- Providing evidence for each assertion\n",
      "- Using appropriate GO terms for molecular functions and biological processes\n",
      "- Including proper annotation of the taxon\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recent Research Context:\n",
      "The model is consistent with recent research on NGD, including:\n",
      "1. The identification of CUE2 as the primary endonuclease in NGD (D'Orazio et al., 2019)\n",
      "2. The role of HEL2 in recognizing collided ribosomes (Ikeuchi et al., 2019)\n",
      "3. The discovery that Cue2 can cleave mRNAs in distinct modes depending on the nature of ribosome collision (Noguchi et al., 2022)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I would suggest the following improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Detailed Mechanism of CUE2 Recruitment**: Recent work by Noguchi et al. (2022) indicates that CUE2 has two distinct modes of action (NGDRQC+ and NGDRQC-) depending on whether the NGD is coupled with Ribosome Quality Control (RQC). The model could be expanded to show these two distinct pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Role of MBF1**: Recent research highlights the role of MBF1 in preventing frameshifting at inhibitory codon pairs during NGD. This could be included to provide a more complete picture of the quality control mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream Fate of mRNA Fragments**: The model could be extended to show the fate of the cleaved mRNA fragments, particularly their degradation by the exosome and Xrn1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Relationship to Other Quality Control Pathways**: The model could potentially benefit from indicating how NGD relates to other quality control pathways such as Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) and Non-Stop Decay (NSD).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "GO-CAM model 63e5937500000215 provides an accurate and well-supported representation of the No-Go decay pathway in yeast, focusing on the roles of HEL2 and CUE2. The model effectively captures the current understanding of how ribosome collisions trigger ubiquitination events that ultimately lead to mRNA degradation. The model is consistent with recent literature and follows GO-CAM best practices. With some minor additions to incorporate recent findings, this model could provide an even more comprehensive view of this important quality control pathway.\n",

      "### Evidence\n",
      "The model is supported by direct experimental evidence (ECO:0000314) from PMID:30893611 and PMID:32615089.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "The model is scientifically accurate and reflects the mechanism of how ribosome collision triggers a quality control response involving detection by HEL2 followed by ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins. The model is consistent with the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The research articles cited (PMID:30893611 and PMID:32615089) provide direct experimental evidence for the associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The primary article describes that HEL2 acts as a sensor for ribosome collisions and then initiates ubiquitination of specific ribosomal proteins, including the 40S ribosomal protein uS3/RPS3.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The model correctly represents the sequential events: HEL2 senses stalled ribosomes, then it initiates a cascade of ubiquitination events involving MAG2 and RSP5.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Function Annotations:**\n",
      "   - The functions assigned are appropriate for the proteins: HEL2, MAG2, and RSP5 all have ubiquitin ligase activity.\n",
      "   - HEL2's dual function as a sensor (GO:0170011) and ligase (GO:0061630) is correctly represented as separate activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological Process Context:**\n",
      "   - Each activity is appropriately linked to relevant biological processes.\n",
      "   - The connection between ribosome rescue (GO:0072344) and protein ubiquitination (GO:0006513 and GO:0070534) is well represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Component:**\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Causal Relationships:**\n",
      "   - The causal flow using \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) appropriately shows the sequence of events and regulatory relationships.\n",
      "   - The model correctly shows HEL2's sensor activity regulating subsequent ubiquitination activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence:**\n",
      "   - Evidence codes are properly used with references to primary literature.\n",
      "   - The direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) is appropriate for the experimental data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Potential Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Downstream Effects:**\n",
      "   - The model title mentions \"18S rRNA degradation\" but the model doesn't explicitly show the steps leading to rRNA degradation after ubiquitination. Adding these steps would complete the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Formation:**\n",
      "   - The model doesn't explicitly represent the formation of ribosome collision complexes (disomes) that HEL2 detects. This could be added to provide more context about what HEL2 is sensing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Participants:**\n",
      "   - Based on the literature (PMID:32615089), the role of other factors like SLH1 in the RQC pathway could be included to give a more complete picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Target Specification:**\n",
      "   - The model does not explicitly identify RPS3/uS3 as the target of ubiquitination, though it's mentioned in the title. This could be added for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides an accurate representation of the initial steps in the ribosome quality control pathway triggered by ribosome collision in yeast. The model follows GO-CAM best practices in terms of molecular functions, biological processes, cellular locations, and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be enhanced by explicitly representing:\n",
      "1. The formation of ribosome collision complexes that HEL2 detects\n",
      "2. The ubiquitination target (RPS3/uS3)\n",
      "3. The steps leading from ubiquitination to rRNA degradation\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality model that accurately represents the current scientific understanding of this pathway. The model successfully captures the key regulatory relationships between HEL2's sensor activity and the subsequent ubiquitination events involving MAG2 and RSP5.\n",

      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the key findings from PMID:27830702, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The signaling pathway where Reg3g inhibits TLR3-mediated inflammation\n",

      "## GO-CAM Curation and Best Practices Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Activity Flow Representation**: The activity flow is represented logically, showing how Reg3g hormone activity leads to receptor binding, downstream signaling, and ultimately inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence Support**: Each activity is supported by appropriate evidence (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence) and references to the source publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate Molecular Function Terms**: The molecular functions assigned to each gene product are appropriate (e.g., hormone activity for Reg3g, protein tyrosine phosphatase activity for PTPN6).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal Associations**: The causal relationships using appropriate relation ontology terms (RO:0002304, RO:0002305, RO:0002629, RO:0002630, RO:0002407) correctly reflect the biological relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, if the model involves complexes where activities are carried out by specific known subunits, these should be represented individually. The model doesn't involve complexes but if it did in the future, this guideline should be followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Taxon Consistency**: The title specifies \"(Mouse)\" but the taxon field shows \"NCBITaxon:9606\" (human). This appears to be an inconsistency that should be corrected, as all gene products are mouse proteins (MGI identifiers).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Detailed Mechanism Representation**: While the model captures the overall pathway, it could potentially be expanded to show more detail about how:\n",
      "   - The PI3K/AKT signaling connects to STAT3 activation (currently implied but not explicitly shown)\n",
      "   - The model could more explicitly show the interaction between SHP-1 and JNK2, which the paper demonstrates through immunoprecipitation experiments\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Semantic Comments**: The model includes automated change comments that indicate previous term replacements, which is good practice for tracking modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is generally well-constructed and accurately represents the biology described in the source publication. The causal relations between molecular functions have been appropriately modeled, and the evidence is well-documented.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correct the Taxon Field**: Update the taxon field to \"NCBITaxon:10090\" (mouse) to match the MGI gene identifiers and model title.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider Additional Mechanistic Detail**: If appropriate, expand the model to show more explicit connections between the PI3K-AKT pathway and STAT3 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Verify Cellular Components**: Ensure all cellular component annotations are accurate (e.g., the paper shows SHP-1 and JNK2 interactions occurring in the cytoplasm, which is correctly captured in the model).\n",
      "\n",
      "The model provides a valuable representation of how Reg3g regulates inflammatory responses in wound healing, which is particularly relevant to understanding impaired wound healing in diabetes. The mechanistic insights captured in this model could be useful for researchers studying wound healing, inflammation, and diabetes complications.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "The model titled \"Activation of the ribosome quality control by ZNF598 in response to ribosome collisions, leading to ubiquitination of RPS20/us10 and ribosome dissociation by the RQT complex, composed of ASCC2 and ASCC3 (Human)\" describes a key quality control pathway in translation regulation. The model captures the process by which stalled or collided ribosomes are detected, marked by ubiquitination, and subsequently dissociated to prevent the production of potentially harmful truncated proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "The model consists of four main molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ZNF598 ([UniProtKB:Q86UK7](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q86UK7)) - stalled ribosome sensor activity (GO:0170011)\n",
      "2. ZNF598 ([UniProtKB:Q86UK7](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q86UK7)) - ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "3. ASCC2 ([UniProtKB:Q9H1I8](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q9H1I8)) - K63-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding (GO:0070530)\n",
      "4. ASCC3 ([UniProtKB:Q8N3C0](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q8N3C0)) - ATP hydrolysis activity (GO:0016887)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current scientific understanding of the ribosome quality control (RQC) pathway as evidenced in the literature (particularly PMID:36302773 and PMID:30293783). The key findings supported by these papers include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ZNF598 functions as a sensor that specifically recognizes collided ribosomes\n",
      "2. ZNF598 mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of uS10 (RPS20)\n",
      "3. ASCC2 specifically binds to K63-linked polyubiquitinated uS10 via its CUE domain\n",
      "4. ASCC3's ATPase activity is required for ribosome dissociation\n",
      "5. The hRQT complex (ASCC2, ASCC3, and TRIP4) works together to disassemble stalled ribosomes\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships in the model follow the established pathway where ZNF598 first recognizes collided ribosomes, then ubiquitinates uS10, which is recognized by ASCC2, which then contributes to ASCC3's ribosome dissociation activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Adherence to GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Component Representation**: The model appropriately represents the key molecular functions of each protein involved in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Relationships**: The model correctly uses the \"RO:0002629\" (directly positively regulates) predicate to connect ZNF598's ubiquitin ligase activity to ASCC2's polyubiquitin binding activity, and to connect ASCC2's binding activity to ASCC3's ATP hydrolysis activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Location**: All activities are correctly annotated to occur in the cytosolic ribosome (GO:0022626).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Process Representation**: The activities are appropriately represented as part of biological processes - either \"rescue of stalled ribosome\" (GO:0072344) or \"ribosome disassembly\" (GO:0032790), which accurately reflect their roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is scientifically accurate and well-constructed according to GO-CAM guidelines, a few enhancements could be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inclusion of TRIP4**: The literature (particularly PMID:36302773) mentions that the complete hRQT complex consists of ASCC2, ASCC3, and TRIP4. While TRIP4 may have a less defined molecular role, its inclusion in the model would provide a more complete representation of the complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Specification of Ubiquitination Target**: It might be beneficial to more explicitly represent RPS20/uS10 as the target of ZNF598's ubiquitin ligase activity, perhaps by adding an annotation indicating the \"has input\" relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Representation of Ribosome Collision**: The initial event that triggers this pathway - ribosome collision - could be more explicitly represented in the model to provide context for ZNF598's sensor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of the ribosome quality control pathway triggered by ZNF598 in response to ribosome collisions. The model captures the causal flow from collision detection to ribosome dissociation, with appropriate molecular functions and relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the evidence from the literature, particularly the most recent findings described in Narita et al. (2022) and Juszkiewicz et al. (2018), which establish that ZNF598 specifically recognizes collided ribosomes and marks them with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are then recognized by ASCC2 to facilitate ASCC3-dependent ribosome dissociation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This model will be valuable for researchers studying translation quality control mechanisms and could serve as a foundation for more detailed models of the RQC pathway.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model titled \"Inhibition of IFNB1 translation initiation by EIF4E2 in response to viral infection. (Human/Sars-CoV-2)\" represents a molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 inhibits the host immune response. The model captures how the viral non-structural protein 2 (NSP2) enhances the function of the cellular GIGYF2/EIF4E2 translation repression complex to inhibit translation of IFNB1 (interferon beta), thereby suppressing antiviral immunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Molecular Components and Activities\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four key proteins with their associated activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **EIF4E2 (O60573)**: Enables RNA 7-methylguanosine cap binding activity (GO:0000340), which is part of the negative regulation of translational initiation process (GO:0045947). This protein, also known as 4EHP, is a cap-binding protein that can repress translation by competing with eIF4E but doesn't recruit the translation initiation machinery.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **GIGYF2 (Q6Y7W6)**: Enables molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090), which is part of the negative regulation of translational initiation process (GO:0045947). GIGYF2 forms a complex with EIF4E2/4EHP to enhance translational repression.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **IFNB1 (P01574)**: Enables cytokine activity (GO:0005125) as part of the type I interferon-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0060337). This is the target of the translational repression.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **SARS-CoV-2 NSP2 (P0DTD1-PRO_0000449620)**: Enables molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) as part of the symbiont-mediated suppression of host translation initiation process (GO:0039606). NSP2 enhances the interaction between GIGYF2 and EIF4E2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model employs three causal associations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. NSP2 directly negatively regulates (RO:0002629) GIGYF2\n",
      "2. GIGYF2 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) EIF4E2\n",
      "3. EIF4E2 causally precedes (RO:0002409) IFNB1\n",
      "\n",
      "These causal relationships capture how NSP2 enhances the ability of GIGYF2 to interact with EIF4E2, which then represses the translation of IFNB1 mRNA.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is supported by evidence from several publications, particularly:\n",
      "\n",
      "- PMID:35878012: Demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 NSP2 interacts with GIGYF2 to enhance its binding to EIF4E2, thereby repressing IFNB1 translation.\n",
      "- PMID:33581076: Shows how 4EHP/EIF4E2 mediates translational control of antiviral immunity by regulating IFNB1 expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 can inhibit the host interferon response through translational repression. The mechanism is consistent with published literature showing that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. EIF4E2 (4EHP) is a cap-binding protein that can repress translation initiation\n",
      "2. GIGYF2 forms a complex with EIF4E2 to enhance translational repression\n",
      "3. SARS-CoV-2 NSP2 directly interacts with GIGYF2 to enhance the GIGYF2-EIF4E2 interaction\n",
      "4. This interaction leads to increased repression of IFNB1 mRNA translation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper use of molecular functions**: Each protein is annotated with appropriate molecular functions (cap binding, molecular adaptor activity, cytokine activity).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper biological process context**: Activities are placed in appropriate biological process contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates to link the activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence support**: Each activity and causal relationship is supported by experimental evidence from published literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, there are a few areas that could potentially be improved:\n",

      "1. **Clarification of causal relationships**: The use of RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for the GIGYF2→EIF4E2 relationship could be clarified, as GIGYF2 actually enhances EIF4E2's repressive function. While this technically does \"positively regulate\" EIF4E2's activity, it might be confusing since the overall effect is negative regulation of translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex representation**: According to the GO-CAM best practices document \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM,\" when the subunits carrying molecular activities are known (as they are in this case), each protein could be represented individually. The model does this properly, but it might be helpful to explicitly note that GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 form a functional complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mechanistic detail**: The model could potentially include additional details about how EIF4E2 represses translation (by competing with eIF4E for cap binding without recruiting the translation machinery) and how NSP2 enhances the GIGYF2-EIF4E2 interaction.\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 NSP2 suppresses host interferon response through translational repression. The model effectively captures the key molecular components, their activities, and the causal relationships between them.\n",

      "The model accurately captures the current understanding of the pathway as supported by the literature. The rescue of stalled ribosomes involves the SKI complex extracting mRNA from stalled ribosomes, followed by PELO/HBS1L recognition, and final dissociation by ABCE1. This agrees with the research in PMID:32006463 and PMID:27863242.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sequence of events is well represented:\n",
      "1. SKI complex extracts mRNA via 3'-5' RNA helicase activity\n",
      "2. HBS1L (GTPase) helps deliver PELO to the stalled ribosomes\n",
      "3. PELO senses the stalled ribosomes and binds to them\n",

      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes. The SKI complex (ComplexPortal:CPX-2736) is used as the entity that enables the 3'-5' RNA helicase activity, which is appropriate since the activity is a property of the complex as a whole rather than an individual protein.\n",

      "## GO-CAM Review: \"TRIM60-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa-B signaling via TAB2 SUMOylation (Human)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Overview\n",
      "This model (https://bioregistry.io/go.model:63f809ec00000347) describes a molecular pathway in which TRIM60 functions as a SUMO E3 ligase that mediates the SUMOylation of TAB2, which in turn inhibits the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by disrupting the TRAF6/TAB2/TAK1 complex. The model involves four proteins:\n",
      "1. TRIM60 (Q495X7) - an E3 SUMO-protein ligase\n",
      "2. TAB2 (Q9NYJ8) - an adaptor protein in the NF-kappa-B pathway\n",
      "3. TRAF6 (Q9Y4K3) - an E3 ubiquitin ligase\n",
      "4. MAP3K7/TAK1 (O43318) - a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Structure & Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents the following causal relations:\n",
      "1. TRIM60 has SUMO-ubiquitin ligase activity (GO:0140082) that directly negatively regulates TAB2's molecular adaptor activity.\n",
      "2. TAB2 has molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) that provides input for TRAF6's ubiquitin ligase activity.\n",
      "3. TRAF6 has ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) that directly positively regulates MAP3K7/TAK1's MAP kinase kinase kinase activity.\n",
      "4. MAP3K7/TAK1 has MAP kinase kinase kinase activity (GO:0004709) as the downstream effector.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the mechanism described in PMID:33184450, which shows that:\n",
      "1. TRIM60 acts as an E3 SUMO ligase for TAB2\n",
      "2. SUMOylation of TAB2 at residues K329 and K562 prevents the formation of the TRAF6/TAB2/TAK1 complex\n",
      "3. This inhibits downstream NF-kappa-B and MAPK activation\n",
      "4. TRIM60 deficiency results in enhanced inflammatory responses\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Process Annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model annotates appropriate biological processes:\n",
      "- TRIM60: negative regulation of non-canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:1901223)\n",
      "- TAB2: non-canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0038061)\n",

      "- MAP3K7/TAK1: canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0007249)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Component Annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "All proteins are correctly annotated as occurring in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737), which is consistent with the subcellular localization of these proteins according to UniProt annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence & References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes and references:\n",
      "- Direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) with references to relevant primary literature\n",
      "- Curator inference (ECO:0000305) where appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Specific Ubiquitination Type**: The model annotates TRAF6 with protein K63-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070534), which is appropriate, but it could be helpful to specify which proteins are being ubiquitinated by TRAF6 in this context (e.g., autoubiquitination of TRAF6 or ubiquitination of TAB2).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MAP3K7/TAK1 Downstream Effects**: The model could potentially be extended to show what happens downstream of MAP3K7/TAK1 activation (e.g., activation of IKK complex and subsequent NF-kappa-B activation).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Addition of UBC13/UEV1A**: The in vitro ubiquitination studies mentioned in PMID:15465037 indicate that UBC13/UEV1A forms a complex with TRAF6 for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Including these components could provide a more complete picture of the TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination process.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows best practices for GO-CAM curation:\n",
      "- It uses appropriate molecular function, biological process, and cellular component annotations\n",
      "- Causal relationships between activities are properly represented with the correct relations (RO:0002413, RO:0002629, RO:0002630)\n",
      "- The model captures a complete signaling pathway from initial regulator (TRIM60) to downstream effect (MAP3K7 activity)\n",
      "- The model is parsimonious and easy to understand\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the TRIM60-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa-B signaling via TAB2 SUMOylation as described in the literature. It follows GO-CAM best practices and provides a clear representation of this regulatory mechanism. The model could be extended to include additional components or downstream effects, but as it stands, it captures the key aspects of this pathway effectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. O60524 (NEMF) is appropriately shown with its alpha-aminoacyl-tRNA binding activity (GO:1904678) located at the cytosolic ribosome (GO:0022626) and involved in CAT tailing (GO:0140708).\n",

      "\n",
      "## Quality Control Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate Biological Content:** The model aligns well with the current literature on the RQC pathway. The interactions between ABCE1, NEMF, LTN1, and ASCC3 are supported by published evidence, particularly the PMID:25578875 paper that describes the structure and assembly pathway of the RQC complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper Annotation of Subcellular Localization:** All activities are correctly annotated to occur at the cytosolic ribosome (GO:0022626), consistent with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate Evidence Citations:** The model includes proper evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) and PMIDs to support each activity and relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Parsimony:** The model efficiently represents the key components and interactions of the RQC pathway without unnecessary complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **NEMF Self-Regulation:** There appears to be a self-regulation where NEMF directly positively regulates itself (the CAT tailing activity). This needs to be checked as it might be a modeling error.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **More Detailed Representation of ASCC3 Function:** Recent literature (PMID:36302773) suggests a more specific role for ASCC3 in recognizing collided ribosomes, which could be represented more explicitly in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mechanism of Ribosome Stalling:** The model could benefit from including the events that lead to ribosome stalling, which is the initiating event for this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Downstream Events:** The model doesn't include the steps after ubiquitination, such as the recruitment of the proteasome and the actual degradation of the ubiquitinated nascent polypeptides.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices Adherence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing activities and their causal relationships. It correctly:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Uses specific gene products rather than complexes when the subunit carrying the activity is known\n",
      "2. Places activities in the proper cellular context\n",
      "3. Uses appropriate causal relationship predicates\n",
      "4. Includes accurate biological process annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality GO-CAM model that accurately represents the RQC pathway in humans. The model is well-supported by literature evidence and follows GO-CAM best practices. The key components (ABCE1, ASCC3, NEMF, and LTN1) and their activities in ribosome disassembly, CAT tailing, and ubiquitination are correctly represented. The causal relationships between these activities are biologically accurate and supported by published evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main area for improvement would be to address the potential self-regulation of NEMF and to possibly expand the model to include events upstream of ribosome stalling and downstream of ubiquitination. Overall, this model would be valuable for researchers studying quality control mechanisms during translation.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model represents the Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) pathway, specifically focusing on the non-canonical activity via CAT-tailing (C-terminal Alanine Tailing) by NEMF that promotes degradation of incompletely synthesized nascent proteins through the DesCEND (destruction via C-end degrons) pathway in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes five key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ATP hydrolysis activity of ASCC3 (Q8N3C0)\n",
      "2. Ribonucleoside triphosphate phosphatase activity of ABCE1 (P61221)\n",
      "3. Alpha-aminoacyl-tRNA binding activity of NEMF (O60524)\n",
      "4. Ribosomal large subunit binding activity of NEMF (O60524)\n",
      "5. Ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity of KLHDC10 (Q6PID8)\n",
      "\n",
      "These activities are connected by causal associations, representing the sequential steps in the RQC pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents current scientific understanding of the RQC pathway as described in the literature, particularly in the publications referenced in the model such as PMID:36302773 and PMID:33909987.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process described aligns with recent research showing that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Stalled ribosomes are detected and trigger the RQC pathway\n",
      "2. ASCC3 functions in the RQT (RQC-Trigger) complex to split collided ribosomes using ATP hydrolysis activity\n",
      "3. ABCE1 is involved in ribosome disassembly\n",
      "4. NEMF (Nuclear Export Mediator Factor) binds to the 60S ribosomal subunit and attaches alanine residues to the C-terminus of the nascent peptide (CAT-tailing)\n",
      "5. The resulting CAT-tailed peptides are recognized by KLHDC10 as part of the CRL2 E3 ligase complex, which targets them for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Review\n",
      "\n",
      "According to GO-CAM best practices for annotating complexes, the model follows appropriate guidelines by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Representing individual proteins with their specific known molecular functions, such as NEMF's alpha-aminoacyl-tRNA binding and ribosomal large subunit binding\n",
      "2. Using causal associations (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\" and RO:0002413 \"provides input for\") to connect the activities appropriately\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly places each activity in appropriate cellular components (cytosolic ribosome GO:0022626 or cytoplasm GO:0005737) and biological processes (ribosome disassembly GO:0032790, rescue of stalled ribosome GO:0072344, CAT tailing GO:0140708, and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the C-end degron rule pathway GO:0140627).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation:** The model effectively captures the sequence of events in the non-canonical RQC pathway involving CAT-tailing by NEMF.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-supported by evidence:** All activities are linked to primary literature sources, with appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clear causal associations:** The model uses appropriate causal relationships to connect activities in a meaningful way that represents the biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper context specification:** Each activity is properly contextualized with cellular component and biological process annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete the ubiquitination pathway:** The model could be expanded to include the complete ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation steps. While KLHDC10's adaptor activity is represented, the actual ubiquitin ligase activity and subsequent proteasomal degradation could be added to make the pathway complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Pirh2/Rchy1 E3 ligase:** According to PMID:33909987, both KLHDC10 and Pirh2/Rchy1 function as E3 ligases that recognize CAT-tailed proteins. Including Pirh2/Rchy1 would provide a more complete picture of the redundancy in this system.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider including recycling factors:** The model could potentially include additional factors involved in recycling or rescue of stalled ribosomes to provide a more comprehensive view of the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add stalling conditions or triggers:** The model could be enhanced by including information about what causes ribosome stalling in the first place (e.g., translation of poly(A) stretches, XBP1u translation, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the non-canonical RQC pathway involving CAT-tailing by NEMF. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for annotating complexes and their activities and is well-supported by current scientific literature. The suggested improvements would mainly serve to expand the comprehensiveness of the model rather than correct any significant issues with the current representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively captures a crucial protein quality control pathway that protects cells from potentially toxic incompletely synthesized proteins, which is important for cellular homeostasis and may have implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases, as mutations in Listerin (the canonical RQC E3 ligase) cause neurodegeneration in mice.\n",

      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes the Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) complex and its function in S. cerevisiae. The model represents how stalled ribosomes are recognized, dissociated, and how the incompletely synthesized nascent proteins are processed through ubiquitination and degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents key components of the RQC complex and their functions, which is consistent with current scientific understanding:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model correctly depicts the activity of SLH1 (SGD:S000003503) in ATP hydrolysis for ribosome disassembly\n",
      "2. The model shows RQC2 (SGD:S000005930) binding to the ribosomal large subunit and its role in CAT tailing\n",
      "3. The ubiquitin ligase activity of RKR1/LTN1 (SGD:S000004861) is properly annotated for targeting the nascent chains\n",
      "4. The adaptor functions of RQC1 (SGD:S000002741) and CDC48 (SGD:S000002284) are included\n",
      "5. The RNA endonuclease activity of VMS1 (SGD:S000002456) is represented correctly\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships between the activities are generally appropriate and follow the RQC pathway as established in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Curation Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence Support**: All assertions are backed by primary research articles with appropriate ECO evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion).\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Proper Part-of Relationships**: The model correctly places the molecular functions within appropriate biological processes (e.g., ribosome disassembly, rescue of stalled ribosome, CAT tailing).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct Causal Relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates between functions:\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) is used correctly to show how one activity promotes another\n",
      "   - RO:0002413 (provides input for) is used correctly for showing sequential steps in the process\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Location**: The model correctly places relevant activities in the cytosolic ribosome (GO:0022626).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input-Output Relationships**: While the model includes a \"has_output\" relationship for VMS1's RNA endonuclease activity producing tRNA precursor (CHEBI:10668), it could benefit from more input-output relationships for other activities. For example, including the ubiquitinated nascent chain as an output of RKR1's ubiquitin ligase activity would enhance completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **RQC Complex Representation**: The model represents individual components of the RQC complex but does not explicitly show them as part of a complex. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, this approach is appropriate when the subunits carrying specific activities are known, which is the case here. However, it might be useful to add a note or annotation indicating these proteins form the RQC complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **CAT Tailing Mechanism**: The CAT tailing process (GO:0140708) is included but could be more detailed about how RQC2 recruits tRNAs for adding alanine and threonine to the C-terminus of stalled nascent chains. The paper by Shen et al. (PMID:25554787) provides details about how RQC2 binds specific tRNAs (Ala-tRNA and Thr-tRNA) that could be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complete Pathway Representation**: The model shows key steps but does not explicitly show the final degradation of the ubiquitinated nascent chain by the proteasome. Adding this final step would complete the pathway representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The annotations follow GO-CAM best practices for representing activities and their relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RKR1/LTN1 is appropriately annotated according to the \"E3 ubiquitin ligases\" guideline document. It correctly uses ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) and places it in the ribosome-associated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:1990116).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The causal relationships used are consistent with the \"Regulation and Regulatory Processes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, using specific causal relationship predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Enhancement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Proteasomal Degradation Step**: Include the final step where the ubiquitinated nascent chain is degraded by the proteasome to complete the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expand Input-Output Relationships**: Add more has_input and has_output relationships to better represent the molecular entities being processed through the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include Stalling Trigger**: Consider adding information about what causes ribosome stalling (e.g., translation of poly(A) tail in nonstop mRNA, rare codon stretches) as context for the beginning of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Information about CAT Tail Function**: The model could indicate that CAT tails help expose lysine residues for ubiquitination and can also promote aggregation when ubiquitination fails.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Connect to Downstream Stress Response**: If applicable, consider extending the model to show how defects in this pathway can trigger cellular stress responses like HSF1 activation, as mentioned in Shen et al. (PMID:25554787).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:63f809ec00000635](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:63f809ec00000635) is a biologically accurate and well-structured representation of the RQC complex in S. cerevisiae. It correctly captures the key molecular players and their causal relationships in handling stalled ribosomes and incompletely synthesized nascent proteins. With some minor enhancements to show additional details and connections, the model would provide an even more comprehensive view of this important quality control mechanism.\n",

      "### Activities in the Model:\n",
      "1. **BZLF1 (P03206)** - A viral transcription factor with DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) that occurs in chromatin (GO:0000785) and is part of release from viral latency (GO:0019046)\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **CSNK2B (P67870)** - Casein kinase II subunit beta with protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674) that occurs in chromatin (GO:0000785) and is part of negative regulation of viral life cycle (GO:1903901). CSNK2B directly positively regulates both ARKL1's corepressor activity and JUN's transcription factor activity.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model:\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular functions**: The assigned molecular functions align with known activities of these proteins.\n",
      "2. **Proper causal relationships**: The causal relationships between proteins correctly represent the biological mechanism.\n",
      "3. **Proper context**: All activities are appropriately contextualized with cellular components and biological processes.\n",
      "4. **Evidence-based**: All activities and relationships are supported by published evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "1. **Missing activity relationships**: The model could more clearly specify whether ARKL1's inhibition of JUN is dependent on CSNK2B-mediated adaptor activity or whether CSNK2B brings ARKL1 and JUN together.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Adaptor mechanism clarification**: According to the molecular adaptor activity guidelines, CSNK2B's adaptor activity should have \"has input\" relationships to both ARKL1 and JUN to clarify that it brings these proteins together. From the literature (specifically PMID:31341047), it appears that CSNK2B mediates the interaction between ARKL1 and JUN, acting as a molecular bridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological process assignment**: While BZLF1 and JUN are appropriately assigned to \"release from viral latency\" (GO:0019046), the model could be enhanced by specifying the exact transcriptional targets beyond BZLF1 itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clarify adaptor mechanism**: Add explicit \"has input\" relationships from CSNK2B's adaptor activity to both ARKL1 and JUN to better represent its role as a molecular adaptor that brings these proteins together.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Refine process annotations**: Consider adding more specific biological process terms to better characterize the exact mechanisms of viral latency regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider adding protein complex**: If the literature supports it, consider representing the CSNK2B-ARKL1-JUN complex explicitly, following the GO-CAM complex annotation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the biological mechanism of how ARKL1 negatively regulates EBV reactivation by inhibiting JUN-mediated transcription, with CSNK2B serving as an adaptor protein. The minor suggested improvements would enhance the clarity and completeness of the model while maintaining its biological accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by representing the transcription factor activities (BZLF1, JUN), transcription coregulator activity (ARKL1), and adaptor activity (CSNK2B) in accordance with the relevant guidelines. The causal relationships are also correctly defined using the appropriate predicates for direct positive and negative regulation.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overall Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents a signaling pathway in which TGF-beta1 (TGFB1) signaling leads to inhibition of transcription through a cascade involving SMAD3, MYC, and TRIM26-mediated ubiquitination of TAF7. The model appears to be based primarily on findings from PMID:29203640, which demonstrated that TGF-beta induces growth arrest through TRIM26-dependent degradation of TAF7, with MYC antagonizing this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context and Pathway Logic\n",
      "\n",
      "The model demonstrates how TGF-beta signaling can inhibit cell proliferation by downregulating transcription. The pathway follows this logical sequence:\n",
      "1. TGFB1 cytokine activity initiates SMAD signaling\n",
      "2. SMAD3 activates DNA-binding transcription factor activity\n",
      "3. SMAD3 provides input for TRIM26 ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "4. TRIM26 directly negatively regulates TAF7\n",
      "5. TAF7 normally functions as an RNA polymerase II general transcription initiation factor\n",
      "6. MYC antagonizes SMAD3 signaling through negative regulation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows that MYC's transcription repressor activity opposes SMAD3 signaling in this pathway, which aligns with the findings from the literature that MYC antagonizes TGF-beta-induced proliferative arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Entity Annotation and Molecular Functions\n",
      "\n",

      "All entities have appropriate molecular functions, cellular components, and are placed within relevant biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses three causal relationships:\n",
      "1. TGFB1 `provides input for` (RO:0002407) SMAD3\n",
      "2. SMAD3 `provides input for` (RO:0002407) TRIM26\n",
      "3. TRIM26 `directly negatively regulates` (RO:0002630) TAF7\n",
      "4. MYC `regulates via a negative effect` (RO:0012010) SMAD3\n",
      "\n",
      "These causal relations appropriately capture the regulatory relationships described in the reference paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Improvement Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on GO-CAM best practices, I have the following recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence Citations**: The evidence is primarily from a single paper (PMID:29203640), which is appropriate. However, additional supporting evidence for the core mechanisms could strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Representation**: Currently the model does not represent any protein complexes. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, if specific activities are carried out by individual proteins within a complex (as is the case here), then representing them as separate entities is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulatory Process Representation**: The model follows the guidelines for regulatory processes by showing specific mechanisms and capturing the negative regulatory effect of TRIM26 on TAF7.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional Mechanistic Details**: If available from the literature, the model could be enhanced by including:\n",
      "   - The specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that works with TRIM26\n",
      "   - The specific lysine residues on TAF7 that are ubiquitinated\n",
      "   - Additional downstream effects of TAF7 degradation\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cell Type Context**: Adding information about the specific cell types where this pathway has been demonstrated would enhance the biological context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"TGF-beta-mediated inhibition of TAF7 via TRIM26\" effectively captures a signaling pathway from TGF-beta through SMAD3 and TRIM26 to the negative regulation of TAF7, with antagonism by MYC. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing regulatory relationships and protein activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-constructed and represents the biological knowledge from the literature accurately. The entities have appropriate molecular function annotations, and the causal relationships between activities reflect our understanding of the pathway. Minor enhancements could be made to add more mechanistic details and cellular context, but overall, this is a high-quality GO-CAM model.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This model represents the [MYD88-dependent TLR4 signaling pathway leading to autophagy activation in humans](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6413ac9800000256). It captures a signaling cascade from TLR4 receptor activity at the plasma membrane through a series of molecular adaptors and kinases, ultimately resulting in autophagosome assembly through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Structure and Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows the following causal chain:\n",
      "1. TLR4 (O00206) signaling receptor activity at plasma membrane → \n",
      "2. TIRAP (P58753) molecular adaptor activity → \n",
      "3. MYD88 (Q99836) molecular adaptor activity → \n",
      "4. IRAK4 (Q9NWZ3) protein serine/threonine kinase activity → \n",
      "5. IRAK2 (O43187) molecular adaptor activity → \n",
      "6. TRAF6 (Q9Y4K3) ubiquitin protein ligase activity → \n",
      "7. BECN1 (Q14457) molecular adaptor activity → \n",
      "8. PIK3C3/VPS34 (Q8NEB9) phosphatidylinositol kinase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly uses the causal relation `RO:0002629` (directly positively regulates) for all connections in the pathway, creating a coherent signal flow from the plasma membrane receptor to autophagosome assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly captures the known signaling pathway from TLR4 activation to autophagy, supported by literature including PMID:33637724 which describes VPS34's role in autophagosome formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Subcellular localization**: Each activity is appropriately associated with a cellular location (plasma membrane for receptors, cytoplasm for downstream components).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence**: All activities and causal relationships are supported by appropriate literature evidence using ECO codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistent use of causal relations**: The model appropriately uses `RO:0002629` (directly positively regulates) for adjacent steps in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Process contextualization**: Activities are properly contextualized within biological processes (e.g., TLR4 signaling pathway, autophagosome assembly).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing lipopolysaccharide input**: While CHEBI:16412 (lipopolysaccharide) is listed in the objects, it's not shown as the initiating input for TLR4 activation. A causal relation showing LPS providing input to TLR4 would improve the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional pathway branches**: The model focuses on a single linear pathway, but TLR4 signaling typically branches to multiple downstream targets. If evidence exists, the model could be expanded to show additional branches.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular complex representation**: According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, if specific subunits carrying molecular activities are known (as in this case), they should be represented directly. The model correctly does this, but it might be helpful to also indicate which proteins form functional complexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Specific mechanism details**: For TRAF6's regulation of BECN1, additional mechanistic details could be added. From the PMID:33637724 paper, we know that ubiquitination plays a key role in this regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Feedback regulation**: The model doesn't capture any potential feedback regulation mechanisms that might exist in this pathway, which could be added if supported by evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Accuracy of Individual Components\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **PIK3C3/VPS34 (Q8NEB9)**: The representation as having phosphatidylinositol kinase activity and being involved in autophagosome assembly is accurate and supported by UniProt information and the literature (PMID:33637724).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **TLR4 signaling components**: The representation of the TLR4 signaling cascade through TIRAP, MYD88, IRAK4, IRAK2, and TRAF6 is consistent with established knowledge of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **BECN1's role**: The model correctly positions BECN1 as a molecular adaptor in autophagy, which is consistent with its known function in the VPS34 complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the MYD88-dependent TLR4 signaling pathway leading to autophagy activation. It correctly captures the key molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships in this pathway. The model could be enhanced by explicitly showing the LPS trigger and potentially expanding to include additional pathway branches or feedback mechanisms. Overall, the model meets GO-CAM best practices and provides a valuable representation of this important cellular signaling pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Consider TICAM1-TRAF3 Complex Formation**: The literature suggests that TICAM1/TRIF forms distinct signaling complexes with TRAF3. The model could potentially be enhanced by representing this complex formation more explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include Additional Co-regulators**: While the core pathway is well-represented, the model could be enhanced by including additional regulatory components like TBK1-IKKε interactions in IRF3 phosphorylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Representation of IRF3 Phosphorylation State**: The model could potentially benefit from explicitly representing the phosphorylated state of IRF3, as this is a critical step for its activation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation.\n",

      "2. **Appropriate Evidence**: The model cites appropriate primary literature sources, with many molecular functions and causal relations supported by experimental evidence (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subcellular Localization**: The model correctly represents subcellular locations of different components, with NOD2 at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), and downstream components appropriately distributed between cytoplasm (GO:0005737) and cytosol (GO:0005829).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal Relationships**: The causal flow is well-represented using appropriate relation terms like \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629), \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413), and \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Entry Receptor for MDP**: The recent research (PMID:36002575) reveals that NAGK (N-acetylglucosamine kinase) is essential for NOD2 activation by phosphorylating MDP at the C6 position. This model includes NAGK (UniProtKB:Q9UJ70) with \"muramyl dipeptide kinase activity\" (GO:0160047), but doesn't properly establish the direct connection between 6-O-phospho-MDP and NOD2 activation. The model shows NAGK providing input to NOD2, but based on the recent publication, NAGK's phosphorylated product (6-O-phospho-MDP) is what actually activates NOD2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ubiquitination Representation**: While the model includes XIAP (P98170) with \"ubiquitin protein ligase activity\" (GO:0061630) and RNF31 (Q96EP0) with \"ubiquitin-protein transferase activity\" (GO:0004842), the ubiquitination events could be more explicitly captured. According to the literature, RIPK2 undergoes both K63-linked and linear (M1-linked) polyubiquitination, which serves as a crucial scaffold for downstream signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Detailed Mechanism for IKK Activation**: The connection between TAK1 complex (consisting of TAK1, TAB2, and TAB3) and IKK activation could be better detailed. TAK1 directly phosphorylates IKK at specific residues (Ser177 and Ser181) as described in PMID:11460167.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Incomplete Information on Feedback Regulation**: The model doesn't include regulatory feedback mechanisms that help control and limit NOD2 signaling, such as deubiquitinating enzymes like A20/TNFAIP3 or OTULIN that can constrain the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Representation**: According to the \"E3_ubiquitin_ligases\" document, the model appropriately represents XIAP as an E3 ligase with appropriate molecular function (GO:0061630) and biological process (GO:0070534 - \"protein K63-linked ubiquitination\").\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Representation**: The model correctly represents the TAK1-TAB2/3 complex by showing molecular activities of individual proteins rather than using a complex ID, which is consistent with the \"How_to_annotate_complexes_in_GO-CAM\" guidelines since the functions of individual subunits are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulation Representation**: The model correctly uses the causal relation terms for regulation, which is consistent with the \"WIP_-_Regulation_and_Regulatory_Processes_in_GO-CAM\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of NOD2 signaling with one significant exception - the role of NAGK in phosphorylating MDP to render it a potent activator of NOD2. The recent breakthrough publication (PMID:36002575) demonstrates that NAGK phosphorylates MDP at the hydroxyl group of the C6 position of its MurNAc moiety to generate 6-O-phospho-MDP, which is the actual ligand recognized by NOD2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes NAGK but doesn't fully capture this critical first step in the pathway. Instead, it shows NAGK directly providing input to NOD2 rather than showing NAGK generating a phosphorylated MDP product that then activates NOD2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Update MDP Recognition Mechanism**: Revise the model to show that NAGK phosphorylates MDP to generate 6-O-phospho-MDP, which then serves as the actual activating ligand for NOD2. This would more accurately represent the findings from PMID:36002575.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Missing Components in Ubiquitination Cascade**: Consider adding more details on the specific ubiquitination patterns of RIPK2 (K63-linked and linear ubiquitination) which serve as a scaffold for recruiting downstream factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include Negative Regulators**: Add negative regulatory components like A20/TNFAIP3 or OTULIN to depict the pathway's regulation more comprehensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarify TAK1-IKK Relationship**: Better detail the specific phosphorylation events from TAK1 to IKK activation.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:641ce4dc00000050) represents a well-constructed depiction of the NOD2 signaling pathway that would benefit from incorporating recent findings on NAGK's role in MDP phosphorylation and adding further details on ubiquitination patterns and pathway regulation.

      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Initiating Signal**:\n",
      "   - The model's title indicates that it represents NOD1 signaling in response to iE-DAP, but there is no explicit connection to this initiating small molecule. According to UniProt and the PMID:12791997 reference, the recognition of iE-DAP is central to NOD1 function.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Include CHEBI:61564 (iE-DAP) with a \"is small molecule activator\" relationship to NOD1's pattern recognition receptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Cellular Component for Some Activities**:\n",
      "   - Some activities lack cellular component annotations that would provide important context.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Add appropriate \"occurs_in\" annotations for all activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Connection between NOD1 and RIPK2**:\n",
      "   - The connection between NOD1 (Q9Y239) and RIPK2 (O43353) could be more clearly represented. According to the literature, NOD1 directly recruits RIPK2 through CARD-CARD domain interactions.\n",
      "   - The model shows RIPK2 (O43353) with \"signaling adaptor activity\" downstream of RNF31, but there should also be a direct connection from NOD1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential Improvements to Pathway Flow**:\n",
      "   - The causal flow from XIAP (P98170) to TAB3 (Q8N5C8) and TAB2 (Q9NYJ8) could be clarified. The model currently shows XIAP providing input for both TAB2 and TAB3, but in the canonical pathway, XIAP catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitination, which is then recognized by the TAB proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add the Initiating Signal**:\n",
      "   - Add CHEBI:61564 (L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid) as a small molecule activator of NOD1's pattern recognition receptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Improve Cellular Localization**:\n",
      "   - Add \"occurs_in\" annotations for activities currently missing this information.\n",
      "   - Ensure NOD1 is correctly shown at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886) based on recent literature (UniProt cites PMID:31649195).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clarify RIPK2 Recruitment**:\n",
      "   - Add a direct causal connection from NOD1's pattern recognition receptor activity to RIPK2's signaling adaptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Adding Additional Information**:\n",
      "   - The model could be enhanced by adding information about the palmitoylation of NOD1, which is required for its localization to the membrane (as indicated in UniProt entry Q9Y239).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ensure Process Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The model could benefit from explicitly showing the role of RNF31 in catalyzing linear polyubiquitination, which is important for NF-κB activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Literature Consistency\n",
      "The model is generally consistent with the referenced literature. The PMID:12791997 paper specifically demonstrates that NOD1 detects a unique muropeptide from Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan, which is correctly represented in this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:641ce4dc00000214) provides a good representation of NOD1 signaling in response to bacterial peptidoglycan components. With a few improvements - particularly the explicit inclusion of the iE-DAP small molecule activator and clarification of some protein-protein interactions - this model would more completely and accurately represent the current understanding of this important innate immune pathway.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This model titled \"NOD2 localization to the plasma membrane following palmitoylation by ZDHHC5 (Human)\" describes the palmitoylation of NOD2 protein by ZDHHC5, which enables NOD2's localization to the plasma membrane, leading to activation of signaling pathways through RIPK2 and XIAP proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context\n",
      "The model represents a crucial aspect of innate immune signaling. NOD2 is a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor that detects bacterial muramyl dipeptide (MDP). For NOD2 to function properly, it must be localized to the plasma membrane, which is facilitated by palmitoylation (the addition of palmitate to specific cysteine residues). This post-translational modification increases NOD2's affinity for membrane bilayers and is essential for its ability to activate downstream signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure\n",
      "The model consists of four main activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ZDHHC5 (UniProtKB:Q9C0B5) with protein-cysteine S-palmitoyltransferase activity (GO:0019706)\n",
      "2. NOD2 (UniProtKB:Q9HC29) with pattern recognition receptor activity (GO:0038187)\n",
      "3. RIPK2 (UniProtKB:O43353) with signaling adaptor activity (GO:0035591)\n",
      "4. XIAP (UniProtKB:P98170) with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Flow\n",
      "The causal flow in the model is:\n",
      "- ZDHHC5 palmitoylates NOD2 (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates)\n",
      "- NOD2 then activates RIPK2 (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates)\n",
      "- RIPK2 activates XIAP (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Context\n",
      "- ZDHHC5 occurs in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",

      "- RIPK2 occurs in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "- XIAP occurs in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",

      "### Biological Processes\n",
      "- ZDHHC5 is part of protein localization to plasma membrane (GO:0072659)\n",

      "The model is well-supported by evidence from multiple peer-reviewed publications:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The role of ZDHHC5 in palmitoylating NOD2 is supported by PMID:34293401 and PMID:31649195\n",

      "2. The cellular locations are accurately represented.\n",
      "3. The causal relationships are appropriately modeled using the correct predicates.\n",
      "4. The evidence is well-documented with appropriate PMIDs and evidence codes.\n",
      "5. The model includes key proteins and their verified molecular functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Issues or Improvements\n",
      "1. **Palmitoylation Sites**: While the model represents the palmitoylation activity, it could be enhanced by noting the specific cysteine residues in NOD2 (C395 and C1033) that are palmitoylated, as indicated in PMID:34293401.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Intermediate Steps**: The model represents a direct relationship between RIPK2 and XIAP, which is accurate, but there could be more detail on the mechanism. XIAP mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIPK2, transforming it into a scaffolding protein for downstream effectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream Effects**: The model could be extended to include the downstream effects of XIAP-mediated ubiquitination of RIPK2, such as activation of the NF-κB and MAP kinases signaling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological Process Annotation**: While NOD2 is correctly annotated as part of \"response to muramyl dipeptide\" (GO:0032495), it could also be annotated to \"innate immune response\" (GO:0045087) to provide more context.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the GO-CAM guidelines for annotating complexes and regulatory processes:\n",

      "## Summary\n",
      "This model represents \"UBL7/TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination of MAVS leading to type I interferon production (Human)\" in the human system (NCBITaxon:9606). It depicts a signaling pathway involved in innate immune response, particularly in antiviral defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains 4 key activities connected by causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **UBL7 (Q96S82)** performs molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "2. **TRIM21 (P19474)** performs ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "3. **MAVS (Q7Z434)** performs molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) on the mitochondrial outer membrane\n",
      "4. **OTUD4 (Q01804)** performs cysteine-type deubiquitinase activity (GO:0004843) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "\n",
      "The activities are connected as follows:\n",
      "- UBL7 provides input for TRIM21's activity\n",
      "- TRIM21 directly negatively regulates MAVS\n",
      "- OTUD4 directly positively regulates UBL7\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are part of the type I interferon production (GO:0032606) biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment of Biological Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the process described in recent literature (primarily PMID:36943869), where UBL7 enhances antiviral innate immunity by promoting Lys27-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS. This ubiquitination is performed by TRIM21, and the process is involved in type I interferon signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly shows:\n",
      "1. UBL7 acts as a molecular adaptor that provides input for TRIM21\n",
      "2. TRIM21 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates MAVS through K27-linked ubiquitination\n",
      "3. MAVS is localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane\n",
      "4. OTUD4 acts as a deubiquitinase that positively regulates UBL7\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correct subcellular locations**: The model accurately depicts the locations of the proteins (MAVS on mitochondrial outer membrane, others in cytoplasm).\n",
      "2. **Appropriate molecular functions**: The assigned molecular functions match what's known about these proteins.\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**: The model correctly depicts the directional flow of the pathway.\n",
      "4. **Evidential support**: All activities and causal relationships have appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Duplicate causal relationship**: OTUD4 has two identical causal relationships to UBL7, both with the predicate \"RO:0002629\" (directly positively regulates), and both referencing the same evidence (PMID:23827681). This appears to be an error and one should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing molecular details**: The model could be more specific about the type of ubiquitination performed by TRIM21 on MAVS. According to UniProt and the referenced literature, this is specifically K27-linked polyubiquitination. The part_of association for TRIM21 does indicate \"GO:0044314\" (protein K27-linked ubiquitination), but this could be made more explicit in the relationship description.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incomplete pathway context**: The model could be extended to show what happens downstream of MAVS inhibition. The title mentions \"leading to type I interferon production,\" but the specific pathway from MAVS to interferon production is not represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **TBK1 presence**: UniProtKB:Q9UHD2 (TBK1) is listed in the objects but is not used in any activity or relationship in the model. If TBK1 plays a role in this pathway, it should be incorporated into the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular activities**: The model correctly specifies the molecular functions of each protein, supported by appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates (provides input for, directly positively/negatively regulates).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular context**: Each activity is correctly annotated with its cellular location.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence**: All activities and relationships have appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Part_of relationships**: All activities are appropriately connected to the biological process they participate in (type I interferon production).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "This model provides a good representation of the UBL7/TRIM21-mediated regulation of MAVS in antiviral signaling, but needs the following corrections:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Remove the duplicate causal relationship from OTUD4 to UBL7.\n",

      "### Overview\n",
      "This model represents the NF-kB signaling pathway in humans, focusing on the activation of the NF-kB transcription factors through the ubiquitination and degradation of the NF-kB inhibitor (NFKBIA/IkB-alpha). The model shows the cascade from upstream kinases to the final activation of NF-kB transcription factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Adherence to E3 ubiquitin ligase guidelines**: \n",
      "   - The model correctly implements the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with distinct roles for scaffold (CUL1, GO:0160072), adaptor (FBXW11, GO:1990756), and ligase (RBX1, GO:0061630) as per the guidelines.\n",
      "   - All components are correctly annotated to the \"proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process\" (GO:0043161).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sequestering activity representation**:\n",
      "   - The inhibitory role of NFKBIA (P25963) is correctly represented with \"protein sequestering activity\" (GO:0140311).\n",
      "   - The sequestering activity directly negatively regulates the transcription factor activities of NFKB1 and RELA, which aligns with the guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**:\n",
      "   - The causal flow from MAP3K7 to IKBKB to the ubiquitination machinery and finally to NF-kB activation is logically structured.\n",
      "   - The predicates used (e.g., RO:0002413 \"provides input for\", RO:0002630 \"directly negatively regulates\") are appropriate for the biological context.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process context**:\n",
      "   - Activities are properly connected to relevant biological processes (e.g., positive/negative regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence and references**:\n",
      "   - Most activities include proper evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence) and references to primary literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing \"has input\" annotations**:\n",
      "   - The NFKBIA protein sequestering activity should have explicit \"has input\" relations to the NF-kB components (NFKB1, RELA) that it sequesters, according to sequestering protein guidelines.\n",
      "   - Similarly, RBX1's ubiquitin ligase activity should have NFKBIA as an explicit input.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Location details**:\n",
      "   - While NFKBIA and IKBKB are annotated to occur in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737), some other proteins lack cellular localization annotations.\n",
      "   - The E3 ligase complex components (CUL1, FBXW11, RBX1) would benefit from cellular location information.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Activity-to-activity causal connections**:\n",
      "   - The connection between the phosphorylation by IKBKB and the subsequent ubiquitination by the E3 ligase complex isn't explicitly modeled, leaving a gap in the causal chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Transcription factor activities**:\n",
      "   - While NFKB1 and RELA have DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) annotations and are properly located in chromatin (GO:0000785), they lack downstream targets, which would complete the pathway.\n",
      "   - According to the guidelines, transcription factors should use more specific molecular function terms indicating activator or repressor activity (e.g., GO:0001228 or GO:0001227).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence completeness**:\n",
      "   - Some causal associations lack evidence codes and references, which would strengthen the model's credibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add \"has input\" annotations to explicitly show what proteins are being sequestered or ubiquitinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider adding the missing link between IKBKB phosphorylation of NFKBIA and the subsequent ubiquitination.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Add cellular component annotations for proteins that currently lack them, especially the E3 ligase complex components.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider extending the model to include downstream transcriptional targets of NF-kB, using more specific transcription factor activity terms.\n",

      "### Conclusion\n",

      "This GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the NF-kB activation pathway through the ubiquitination and degradation of its inhibitor.

      "This GO-CAM model titled \"Generation of NFKB1 p50 subunit of Nf-kappa-B via limited processing by the KPC1 complex (RNF123), leading to NF-kappa-B inhibitor (Human)\" represents a biological process related to the regulation of NF-kappa-B signaling in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components and Structure\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Key components include:\n",
      "- IKBKB (O14920): Acts as a protein kinase and IkappaB kinase\n",
      "- RNF123/KPC1 (Q5XPI4): Functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase\n",

      "\n",
      "## Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current scientific understanding of NFKB1 processing by the KPC1 complex as described in the literature, particularly in Kravtsova-Ivantsiv et al. (2015). The key mechanisms are well captured:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. IKBKB phosphorylates p105 at Ser-927 (supported by PMID:11297557)\n",
      "2. RNF123/KPC1 ubiquitinates p105, leading to its limited proteasomal processing to p50 (supported by PMID:25860612)\n",
      "3. The generated p50 functions as a DNA-binding transcription factor\n",
      "4. NFKBIA inhibits the activity of NF-kappa-B components through protein sequestering activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities and their causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper activity representation**: Each protein is annotated with appropriate molecular functions (e.g., IKBKB with kinase activity, RNF123 with ubiquitin ligase activity).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal relations**: The model uses appropriate causal relations:\n",
      "   - RO:0002409 (negatively regulates upstream of or within): IKBKB to NFKBIA \n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates): RNF123 to NFKB1 DNA-binding activity\n",
      "   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates): NFKBIA to NFKB1 and RELA\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complex representation**: The model correctly handles the KPC1 complex by annotating RNF123 (which is the catalytic subunit) with the ubiquitin ligase activity, which follows the guidelines for representing complexes where the subunit carrying the molecular activity is known.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular location**: Each activity is appropriately annotated with cellular location (e.g., cytoplasm, chromatin) and is consistent with the known biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence codes**: All annotations are supported by appropriate evidence codes and PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, there are a few points that could be improved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **KPC Complex Representation**: The model correctly shows RNF123/KPC1 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase, but it might be beneficial to include the partner protein KPC2 (UBAC1) as described in the literature. The KPC complex is a heterodimer composed of KPC1 and KPC2, and although KPC1 has the catalytic activity, KPC2 plays a role in stabilizing KPC1 and affecting its activity toward p105.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Phosphorylation Site Specificity**: While the model shows IKBKB phosphorylating NFKB1, it could be more specific about the phosphorylation occurring at Ser-927, which is critical for subsequent processing by KPC1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulatory Mechanism Completeness**: The relationship between IKBKB phosphorylation and enhanced KPC1-mediated ubiquitination could be made more explicit, as the literature indicates that phosphorylation of p105 increases its interaction with KPC1.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current knowledge about the generation of the NF-kappa-B p50 subunit via KPC1-mediated processing of p105, and its subsequent roles in NF-kappa-B signaling. \n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the literature, especially the key publication by Kravtsova-Ivantsiv et al. (2015), and follows GO-CAM best practices. The minor suggestions for improvement would enhance the model's completeness and specificity but don't detract from its current quality and usefulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological representation is sound, with each protein annotated with appropriate molecular functions and located in the correct cellular compartments. The causal relationships between activities are properly represented using the appropriate RO relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend this model for approval with the optional suggestion to consider adding KPC2 and being more specific about the phosphorylation site in future iterations.\n",

      "### Summary of the Model\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is titled \"Human metapneumovirus M2-2 inhibition of IRF7 (Human-Metapneumovirus)\" and depicts interactions between human metapneumovirus (HMPV) M2-2 protein and the host innate immune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four main activities:\n",
      "1. **HMPV M2-2 protein (UniProtKB:Q6WB96)** - Protein sequestering activity (GO:0140311) occurring in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "2. **TBK1 (UniProtKB:Q9UHD2)** - Protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) occurring in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "3. **TLR9 (UniProtKB:Q9NR96)** - Pattern recognition receptor activity (GO:0038187) occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (GO:0005783)\n",
      "4. **IRF7 (UniProtKB:Q92985)** - DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0000981) occurring in chromatin (GO:0000785)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "1. HMPV M2-2 directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) IRF7\n",
      "2. TBK1 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) IRF7\n",
      "3. TLR9 provides input for (RO:0002407) TBK1\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence\n",
      "The model is supported by experimental evidence from several scientific papers:\n",
      "- PMID:28768858 - Primary paper showing that HMPV M2-2 protein acts as a negative regulator of IFN-alpha production by inhibiting IRF7 phosphorylation\n",
      "- PMID:25636800 - Evidence for TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of IRF7\n",
      "- PMID:14716310 - Evidence for TLR9 subcellular localization and function\n",
      "- PMID:23857366 - Evidence for TLR9 role in signaling pathway\n",

      "- PMID:17404045 - Evidence for IRF7 transcription factor activity\n",

      "- PMID:16979567 - Evidence for IRF7 role in interferon production\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Context\n",
      "This model represents how the HMPV M2-2 protein interferes with the host innate immune response. The pathway normally involves TLR9 sensing viral/bacterial DNA in endosomes, leading to TBK1 activation, which then phosphorylates IRF7. Activated IRF7 translocates to the nucleus and induces type I interferon production. The HMPV M2-2 protein disrupts this pathway by directly binding to IRF7 and preventing its phosphorylation by TBK1, thereby inhibiting the host interferon response.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Review Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Scientific Accuracy**: The model accurately represents the core mechanism of HMPV M2-2 protein's inhibitory effect on IRF7 as described in the primary literature (PMID:28768858).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-evidenced**: Each component and relationship in the model is supported by appropriate evidence from peer-reviewed literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clear Biological Context**: The model clearly depicts how a viral protein disrupts a specific host immune signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate Use of GO Terms**: The molecular function terms assigned to each protein are appropriate based on their known functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Annotation**: Based on the GO-CAM guidelines for complex annotation, there may be opportunities to improve the representation of protein complexes or multi-protein interactions. The M2-2 interaction with IRF7 is a direct binding interaction according to the literature, which is correctly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Subcellular Localization Accuracy**: According to the literature, TLR9 is initially localized to the ER (as correctly shown in the model) but relocates to endosomes/lysosomes upon CpG DNA binding. The model could potentially be enhanced to show this translocation, though for simplicity the current representation is acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Signal Transduction Completeness**: The signaling pathway from TLR9 activation to IRF7 phosphorylation involves additional components like MyD88 and TRAF6 that aren't represented in the current model. While the model correctly represents the core pathway affected by M2-2, including these intermediary steps would make it more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Phosphorylation Events**: The model represents that TBK1 directly positively regulates IRF7, but could be more specific to indicate that this regulation occurs via phosphorylation specifically at Ser477 (as shown in PMID:28768858). \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Additional Outcomes**: The biological process of \"negative regulation of type I interferon production\" (GO:0032480) is correctly annotated to M2-2, but the model could potentially include the downstream effects on interferon production more explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consider Adding Molecular Detail**: Consider adding the specific phosphorylation site of IRF7 (Ser477) as mentioned in the primary paper to provide more molecular detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expand the Signaling Pathway**: If the goal is a more comprehensive model, consider adding MyD88 and TRAF6 as intermediate steps between TLR9 and TBK1 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add Downstream Effects**: Consider expanding the model to show how IRF7 inhibition leads to reduced interferon production, potentially including interferon genes as outputs of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarify Cellular Locations**: Consider adding a more detailed representation of TLR9 translocation from the ER to endosomes upon activation, as this is an important aspect of its signaling mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Human metapneumovirus M2-2 inhibition of IRF7 (Human-Metapneumovirus)\" is scientifically accurate and well-supported by evidence. It effectively captures the core mechanism by which HMPV M2-2 protein disrupts host innate immune signaling by targeting IRF7. The model follows GO-CAM best practices regarding evidence citations and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are opportunities to expand the model with additional molecular detail and pathway components, the current representation is parsimonious and clearly communicates the essential biological mechanism.

      "1. **Complex representation**: The model doesn't explicitly show the RIG-I/TRIM25 complex formation that is described in the literature.

      "**Title**: \"Activation of the WNK1-SPAK/OSR1 kinase cascade in response to hyperosmotic stress, leading to promote ion influx and prevent ion efflux (Human)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Taxon**: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the WNK1-SPAK/OSR1 kinase signaling pathway that regulates ion transport in response to hyperosmotic stress in human cells. The model describes how the WNK1 kinase is activated under hyperosmotic conditions, leading to the activation and phosphorylation of SPAK (STK39) and OSR1 (OXSR1) kinases, which in turn regulate the activities of multiple cation-chloride cotransporters: KCC (SLC12A6), NKCC1 (SLC12A2), and NKCC2 (SLC12A1).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures the known biology of the WNK1-SPAK/OSR1 signaling cascade based on the current literature. The recent publication by Sun et al. (2022) (PMID:36318922) provides strong support for the mechanisms represented in this model, highlighting how WNK1 forms phase-separated condensates under hyperosmotic stress to coordinate signaling that regulates cell volume through cation-chloride cotransporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly shows that:\n",
      "1. WNK1 undergoes molecular condensate scaffold activity under hyperosmotic stress\n",
      "2. WNK1 activates SPAK/OSR1 through phosphorylation\n",
      "3. Activated SPAK/OSR1 phosphorylates and regulates cation-chloride cotransporters\n",
      "4. This leads to both activation of ion influx transporters (NKCC1, NKCC2) and inhibition of ion efflux transporters (KCC)\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Modeling Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological Process Integration**: The model appropriately connects all activities to the \"cell volume homeostasis\" (GO:0006884) biological process, which is the main physiological outcome of this signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular Activities**: Each protein is annotated with appropriate molecular functions:\n",
      "   - WNK1: molecular condensate scaffold activity (GO:0140693) and protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "   - SPAK/OSR1: protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "   - Cotransporters: appropriate transporter activities (GO:0015379, GO:0008511)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Localization**: The model includes appropriate cellular locations for each activity:\n",
      "   - WNK1 condensate formation in intracellular membraneless organelle (GO:0043232)\n",
      "   - Cotransporters at appropriate plasma membrane locations\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal Relationships**: The causal relationships between activities are well represented using the appropriate causal predicates:\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for activating phosphorylation \n",
      "   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for inhibitory phosphorylation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Duplicate Causal Relationships**: There are duplicate causal relationships between STK39 (SPAK) and SLC12A6 (KCC). In the model, there are two separate \"directly negatively regulates\" relationships from STK39 to SLC12A6's potassium:chloride symporter activity, with one relationship lacking evidence (empty evidence array).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Osmotic Response**: Although the model is focused on the response to hyperosmotic stress, it doesn't explicitly include the GO term for \"cellular hyperosmotic response\" (GO:0071474) as a biological process. This term is mentioned in the model's objects list but isn't connected to any activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular Input Details**: While the model does capture the role of WNK1 as a molecular condensate scaffold, it could benefit from explicitly modeling how hyperosmotic stress triggers this activity, possibly through the addition of small molecules or physical conditions as inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by high-quality evidence:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) from multiple PMIDs\n",
      "- Key publications supporting the model include PMID:36318922, PMID:19665974, and PMID:21321328\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence is correctly associated with the appropriate molecular activities and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Completeness\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the core components of the WNK1-SPAK/OSR1 pathway and its regulation of cation-chloride cotransporters. However, it could be expanded to include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The detailed molecular mechanisms by which hyperosmotic stress triggers WNK1 phase separation (as described in PMID:36318922)\n",
      "2. The specific phosphorylation sites on the cotransporters (e.g., Thr105 and Ser130 on NKCC2, as described in PMID:21321328)\n",
      "3. Additional downstream effects on cellular processes beyond ion transport\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows most GO-CAM best practices for representing signaling pathways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: The model correctly represents individual proteins rather than complexes where the specific activities of individual components are known, consistent with the guidelines in \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regulatory Relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal predicates (RO:0002629 and RO:0002630) to represent the phosphorylation-mediated activation and inhibition relationships, in line with the \"Regulation and Regulatory Processes in GO-CAM\" guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Transporter Activities**: The cotransporter activities are annotated with appropriate cellular locations and corresponding biological processes, consistent with the \"Transporter activity annotation guidelines.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove Duplicate Causal Relationship**: Eliminate the duplicate \"directly negatively regulates\" relationship from STK39 to SLC12A6 that lacks evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Cellular Hyperosmotic Response**: Include GO:0071474 (cellular hyperosmotic response) as a biological process and connect it to the WNK1 activities as an overarching context.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expand Molecular Details**: Consider adding:\n",
      "   - Specific phosphorylation sites on cotransporters\n",
      "   - Molecular triggers of WNK1 phase separation (molecular crowding as described in PMID:36318922)\n",
      "   - Additional downstream effects on cellular processes\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complete Evidence for All Relationships**: Ensure that all causal relationships have appropriate evidence annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current knowledge of the WNK1-SPAK/OSR1 signaling pathway in response to hyperosmotic stress. With minor refinements as suggested above, the model would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important cellular regulatory pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model makes a valuable contribution to the GO-CAM knowledge base by connecting molecular activities from multiple proteins into a coherent biological process with clear physiological relevance to cell volume regulation and osmotic response.\n",

The model shows a signaling cascade where WNK4 (Q96J92) regulates ion transport by phosphorylating and activating the downstream kinases OXSR1 (O95747) and STK39 (Q9UEW8), which then phosphorylate and activate the sodium-chloride cotransporter SLC12A3/NCC (P55017).\n",

      "\n",
      "The model includes four key activities:\n",
      "1. WNK4 (Q96J92) protein serine/threonine kinase activity\n",
      "2. OXSR1 (O95747) protein serine/threonine kinase activity\n",
      "3. STK39 (Q9UEW8) protein serine/threonine kinase activity\n",
      "4. SLC12A3/NCC (P55017) sodium:chloride symporter activity\n",

      "- WNK4 directly positively regulates both OXSR1 and STK39\n",
      "- Both OXSR1 and STK39 directly positively regulate SLC12A3/NCC\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC signaling pathway that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. This pathway is important for blood pressure regulation, as evidenced by the fact that mutations in WNK kinases cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (Gordon syndrome), a form of hypertension that responds to thiazide diuretics (which inhibit NCC).\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence used to support the model comes from high-quality experimental data, including:\n",

      "- WNK4 activity in the bicellular tight junction (GO:0005923)\n",
      "- OXSR1 and STK39 activities in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",

      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Organization and Clarity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "- Using appropriate molecular function terms for each protein activity\n",
      "- Including cellular component information for localization\n",
      "- Properly connecting activities with causal associations\n",
      "- Including evidence codes and literature references\n",
      "\n",
      "### Proper Use of Annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **MF annotations**: Each protein is correctly annotated with appropriate molecular function terms:\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Further downstream effects**: The model could be extended to show the physiological consequences of NCC activation, such as increased sodium reabsorption and its effects on blood pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Negative regulatory components**: The model could include negative regulators of this pathway, such as the ubiquitin ligase complexes containing KLHL3 that target WNK kinases for degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Parallel pathways**: Consider adding other WNK kinases (WNK1, WNK3) that also regulate SPAK/OSR1 and NCC, which would provide a more complete view of NCC regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pathway modulators**: Include the role of hormones like aldosterone that affect this pathway.\n",

      "1. **Complete pathway representation**: The model successfully captures the entire triglyceride biosynthetic pathway with all major enzymatic steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper causal connections**: Activities are connected with the appropriate causal relationship predicates (RO:0002413 \"provides input for\"), showing a clear flow from one activity to the next.\n",

      "3. **Detailed cellular locations**: Each activity correctly specifies subcellular locations (ER membrane, mitochondrial outer membrane, cytosol).\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Taxon specificity**: The model properly specifies mouse gene products (MGI identifiers).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing part_of annotation**: Activity `gomodel:6446bfcb00000006/6446bfcb00000079` (phosphatidate phosphatase activity) has a part_of relationship to GO:0019432 (triglyceride biosynthetic process) without any evidence codes. All other activities have evidence for this relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Potentially incomplete causal chain**: The activity `gomodel:6446bfcb00000006/6446bfcb00000015` (diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase activity) is the final step in the pathway but doesn't have outgoing causal connections to a product or outcome. Consider whether this represents the complete pathway or if additional connections are needed.\n",

      "3. **No biological context**: The model lacks information about what specific biological context this triglyceride synthesis occurs in (e.g., response to feeding, specific developmental stage, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Correctness\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gene Products and Functions**:\n",

      "   - Functions accurately represent the enzymatic activities in triglyceride synthesis\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Flow**:\n",
      "   The causal flow appears correct, following the established pathway:\n",
      "   - Glyceryl-ether monooxygenase → Glycerol kinase → Glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase\n",
      "   - 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase → Phosphatidate phosphatase → Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Locations**:\n",
      "   - Cellular locations are appropriate for each enzyme\n",
      "   - The model correctly represents that different steps occur in different cellular compartments\n",

      "## Consistency with Literature\n",
      "The model is well-supported by primary literature citations. Each activity and relationship has appropriate evidence codes and PMID references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add evidence for missing annotation**: Add appropriate evidence for the part_of relationship between phosphatidate phosphatase activity and triglyceride biosynthetic process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider pathway completion**: Evaluate whether the final step should connect to a product or another process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider annotating the biological context**: If known from the literature, adding information about when/why this pathway is activated would improve the model's utility.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "- **Title**: \"Negative regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway 1 (Mouse)\"\n",
      "- **Taxon**: Mouse (NCBITaxon:10090)\n",
      "- **Status**: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Content\n",
      "This model represents the negative regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in mouse. The model includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A signaling pathway initiated by EGF (MGI:MGI:95290) binding to EGFR (MGI:MGI:95294)\n",
      "2. Activation of EGFR's protein tyrosine kinase activity\n",
      "3. Involvement of Cbl (MGI:MGI:88279) E3 ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "4. Eps15 (MGI:MGI:104583) ubiquitin binding activity\n",
      "5. Occurs in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "6. The entire pathway leads to negative regulation of EGFR signaling pathway (GO:0042059)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "1. The model correctly depicts the sequential events in EGFR negative regulation\n",
      "2. Proper representation of causal relationships using appropriate RO relations\n",
      "3. Correct location annotations (plasma membrane)\n",
      "4. Good evidence codes with appropriate PMIDs supporting the assertions\n",
      "5. Proper representation of molecular functions for each gene product\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Missing Context for Ubiquitin-Dependent Endocytosis\n",
      "The model indicates that Eps15's ubiquitin binding activity (ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis GO:0070086) is part of the negative regulation of EGFR signaling, but does not fully represent how this leads to EGFR degradation. The lysosome (GO:0005764) is listed in the objects but not used in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Molecular Details of EGFR Ubiquitination\n",
      "The mechanism by which Cbl's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity leads to EGFR ubiquitination should be more explicitly represented. Based on the literature review (PMID:23457600 and PMID:15383614), Cbl-mediated ubiquitination is a key step that needs clearer representation in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Additional Molecular Functions\n",
      "The literature indicates that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity phosphorylates Cbl, which enhances its ubiquitin ligase activity. This phosphorylation event could be more explicitly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Complex Representation\n",
      "According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, when specific subunits carrying molecular activities are known (as in this case), they should be represented individually with their specific activities. The model correctly does this for the most part, but could be improved by ensuring that all relevant complex components (if any) are included.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Other Feedback\n",
      "- The model could benefit from including the regulation of EGFR internalization after ubiquitination\n",
      "- The role of Eps15 in endocytosis could be expanded to show how it connects to the sorting of ubiquitinated EGFR to lysosomes\n",
      "- Consider including other components of the endocytosis machinery that interact with ubiquitinated EGFR\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "\n",
      "The cited PMIDs (23457600, 15383614, 14627991) appear to support the annotations, although I was unable to access the full text of some of these papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Ontology Term Usage\n",
      "The GO terms used in the model are appropriate for the biological processes being represented:\n",
      "- GO:0061630 (ubiquitin protein ligase activity)\n",
      "- GO:0004713 (protein tyrosine kinase activity)\n",
      "- GO:0042059 (negative regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway)\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "The GO-CAM model 6446bfcb00000319 is a well-constructed representation of EGFR negative regulation in mouse. It correctly represents the key molecular activities and their causal relationships. With some minor improvements in representing the complete pathway of EGFR ubiquitination, endocytosis, and lysosomal degradation, this model would provide a more comprehensive representation of the biological process.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the negative regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in mouse. The model depicts how the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Cbl ([MGI:MGI:88279](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:88279)) negatively regulates EGFR ([MGI:MGI:95294](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:95294)) signaling with the involvement of other proteins like Eps15 ([MGI:MGI:104583](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:104583)) and Grb2 ([MGI:MGI:95805](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:95805)).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Review\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the known mechanism for EGFR downregulation through ubiquitination, capturing several key molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model starts with EGF ([MGI:MGI:95290](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:95290)) binding to EGFR, activating the receptor.\n",
      "2. EGFR's receptor activity then activates Grb2's molecular adaptor activity.\n",
      "3. Grb2 leads to activation of EGFR's protein tyrosine kinase activity.\n",
      "4. EGFR's tyrosine kinase activity is linked to Cbl's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.\n",
      "5. Cbl's E3 ligase activity directly positively regulates Eps15's ubiquitin binding activity.\n",
      "6. Eps15's ubiquitin binding activity directly positively regulates EGFR's protein tyrosine kinase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "This captures the known sequential steps in EGFR downregulation via endocytosis, where:\n",
      "- EGF binding activates EGFR\n",
      "- Cbl ubiquitinates EGFR\n",
      "- Eps15 (containing ubiquitin-interacting motifs) recognizes ubiquitinated EGFR\n",
      "- This leads to receptor internalization and downregulation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular functions**: The model uses appropriate molecular functions for each protein:\n",
      "   - EGFR: Protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713) and EGFR activity (GO:0005006)\n",
      "   - Cbl: Ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "   - Eps15: Ubiquitin binding (GO:0043130)\n",
      "   - Grb2: Molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090)\n",
      "   - EGF: Receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular components**: The model correctly places EGFR and Cbl at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), consistent with literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological processes**: Activities are appropriately associated with the biological processes they contribute to:\n",
      "   - Negative regulation of EGFR signaling pathway (GO:0042059)\n",
      "   - Ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis (GO:0070086)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal relations**: The causal relations use the appropriate \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) relationship throughout the model, which is consistent with the GO-CAM guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well supported by literature-based evidence. Key evidence includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PMID:11823423 - Evidence for Cbl's activity in EGFR regulation and the involvement of Grb2\n",
      "2. PMID:15383614 - Evidence for the role of Eps15 in EGFR endocytosis \n",
      "3. PMID:12754251 - Supporting evidence for Cbl's role in the pathway\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence codes used (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence, ECO:0000316 - genetic interaction evidence, ECO:0000315 - mutant phenotype evidence) are appropriate for the assertions made.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Subcellular location consistency**: While EGFR and Cbl are correctly located at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), no cellular location is specified for Eps15's ubiquitin binding activity. According to the UniProt entry (P42567), Eps15 is found in clathrin-coated pits, which would be appropriate to include.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Process completion**: The model could be extended to include the final steps of EGFR downregulation, including endosomal trafficking and lysosomal degradation. Currently, it focuses on the early steps of ubiquitination and recognition of ubiquitinated EGFR.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional molecular details**: The model could potentially include:\n",
      "   - EGFR dimerization step following ligand binding\n",
      "   - The specific sites of EGFR phosphorylation\n",
      "   - The role of clathrin and the AP2 adaptor complex in the endocytic process\n",
      "\n",
      "## Parsimony and Readability\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is very focused and parsimonious, making it easy to understand the key regulatory mechanism. It clearly shows how Cbl-mediated ubiquitination leads to EGFR downregulation with the involvement of Eps15 as a key ubiquitin-binding protein in the endocytic machinery.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:6446bfcb00000544) provides an accurate, well-evidenced representation of EGFR negative regulation through the Cbl-mediated ubiquitination pathway. It follows GO-CAM best practices and uses appropriate molecular function terms, biological process terms, and causal relationships. The minor suggestions for improvement would primarily add more details to the existing mechanism rather than correcting any significant issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully captures the core mechanism of EGFR downregulation, which is a critical process for controlling growth factor signaling and preventing excessive cell proliferation.\n",

      "This model represents the regulatory mechanisms of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in mouse. It focuses on the negative regulation of EGFR signaling through ubiquitination and endocytosis, as well as the positive regulation mechanisms involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key proteins in this model include:\n",
      "- Egfr (MGI:MGI:95294) - Mouse epidermal growth factor receptor\n",
      "- Spry2 (MGI:MGI:1345138) - Sprouty homolog 2\n",
      "- Cbl (MGI:MGI:88279) - E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase\n",

      "\n",
      "## Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures key aspects of EGFR signaling regulation based on the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cbl-mediated negative regulation**: The model correctly shows Cbl (MGI:MGI:88279) functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (GO:0061630) that negatively regulates EGFR signaling through ubiquitination, which is consistent with the literature (PMID:11894095).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Role of adaptor proteins**: The inclusion of Sh3kbp1 (CIN85 ortholog) with molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) participating in ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis (GO:0070086) is well-supported by the PMID:11894095 paper, which specifically describes the Cbl-CIN85-endophilin complex in EGFR downregulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Spry2 dual function**: The model captures the dual role of Spry2 - both as an enzyme inhibitor (GO:0004857) and as having molecular function inhibitor activity (GO:0140678), which corresponds to its known complex regulatory role in EGFR signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices, with a few points to note:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity connections**: The causal relationships between activities are mostly appropriate. For example:\n",
      "   - Cbl's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is correctly shown as part of the negative regulation of EGFR signaling pathway\n",
      "   - Egfr protein tyrosine kinase activity directly positively regulates Spry2 activity, which is biologically accurate\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence usage**: The model appropriately uses evidence codes and citations:\n",
      "   - ECO:0000266 (sequence orthology evidence) for cross-species inferences\n",
      "   - ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence) for functional assertions\n",
      "   - ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) for experimentally validated interactions\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I suggest the following improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incomplete mechanistic representation**: The model could benefit from a more complete representation of the endocytosis process. From PMID:11894095, we know that endophilins are crucial components of this pathway, but they aren't explicitly represented in the model. Consider adding:\n",
      "   - Endophilin proteins that interact with Sh3kbp1\n",
      "   - Specific clathrin-mediated endocytosis activities\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process**: While the model shows Cbl's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, it doesn't explicitly include GO:0006511 (ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process) as a downstream biological process, which would more clearly connect the ubiquitination to receptor degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular function context**: For Cbl's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, the model should specify which protein is being ubiquitinated (EGFR) as specified in the E3 ubiquitin ligases documentation, which indicates \"has input the substrate protein\" should be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence for some interactions**: Some causal associations lack evidence codes or are based on orthology evidence where direct experimental evidence might be preferable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:6446bfcb00001000](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6446bfcb00001000) provides a biologically accurate representation of EGFR signaling regulation in mouse, focusing on the Cbl-mediated negative regulation pathway. The model correctly captures the key molecular functions, biological processes and protein interactions involved in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main strengths are the accurate representation of Cbl's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in EGFR downregulation and the inclusion of adaptor proteins like Sh3kbp1. The model could be improved by providing a more detailed representation of the endocytosis mechanism, explicitly including the ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, and specifying the ubiquitination substrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality model that aligns well with current literature on EGFR signaling regulation and follows GO-CAM best practices, with minor improvements suggested to enhance its completeness and clarity.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This model represents the thiamine diphosphate biosynthetic process in mice (Mus musculus). It includes several key activities involved in the transport and metabolism of thiamine (vitamin B1) to produce thiamine diphosphate (TPP), the metabolically active form of thiamine.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following activities and molecular functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thiamine transmembrane transport** by two transporters:\n",
      "   - [Slc19a2](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:1928761) (thiamine transporter 1) at the plasma membrane\n",
      "   - [Slc19a3](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:1931307) (thiamine transporter 2) at the plasma membrane\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thiamine phosphorylation** by:\n",
      "   - [Tpk1](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:1352500) (thiamine pyrophosphokinase 1) in the cytosol performing thiamine diphosphokinase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Thiamine pyrophosphate transport** by:\n",
      "   - [Slc25a19](https://bioregistry.io/MGI:MGI:1914533) at the mitochondrial inner membrane performing thiamine pyrophosphate transmembrane transporter activity\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The model represents a causal flow with the following associations:\n",
      "   - The thiamine transmembrane transporters (Slc19a2 and Slc19a3) provide input for Tpk1\n",
      "   - Tpk1 provides input for Slc25a19 transporter\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate pathway representation**: The model correctly captures the biochemical flow of thiamine from extracellular uptake to conversion to the active TPP form and subsequent mitochondrial transport.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate evidence**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 for direct assay and ECO:0000315 for mutant phenotype) and relevant PMIDs to support the annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct cellular localization**: The components are correctly localized in their respective cellular compartments: plasma membrane for thiamine transporters, cytosol for the phosphorylation step, and mitochondrial inner membrane for TPP transport.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper causal relationships**: The model uses RO:0002413 (\"provides input for\") appropriately to show the flow of thiamine through the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity diagram completeness**: The model would benefit from including the final destination of TPP in the mitochondria and its role in key TPP-dependent enzymes like alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Showing the ultimate biological outcomes of the pathway would enhance the model's comprehensiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify physiological significance**: The model could benefit from annotations that highlight the importance of this pathway and consequences of dysfunction, especially given the research showing how deficiencies lead to severe neurological disorders as seen in the PMID:28665968 study.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulatory elements**: The model could be enhanced by including known regulatory factors that affect thiamine transport or metabolism, if they are known. For example, factors that regulate the expression or activity of the transporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Process resolution**: The thiamine diphosphate biosynthetic process (GO:0009229) is used as a 'part_of' for all activities, but it might be helpful to include more granular processes in some cases (e.g., \"thiamine transport\" for the transporters specifically).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using appropriate molecular function terms for each protein\n",
      "2. Correctly representing the cellular components where each activity occurs\n",
      "3. Using appropriate causal relations between activities\n",
      "4. Providing published evidence for the annotated functions\n",

      "1. The model accurately reflects the known pathway for thiamine metabolism in mammals.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The research from PMID:22194418 supports the role of both Slc19a2 and Slc19a3 in thiamine transport, with relative contribution of both transporters being important.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. PMID:17035501 confirms the function of Slc25a19 as a mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate transporter rather than a deoxyribonucleotide transporter as previously thought.\n",

      "## Overview of the GO-CAM Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This model describes the thiamine diphosphate biosynthetic pathway in mouse cells, including:\n",
      "- 5 molecular activities carried out by different proteins\n",
      "- 3 causal relationships between activities\n",
      "- Multiple cellular compartments (plasma membrane, cytosol, mitochondrial inner membrane)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation of Biological Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model describes a pathway for thiamine (vitamin B1) uptake, transport, and metabolism in mouse cells, focusing on the following key steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Thiamine transmembrane transporters (Slc19a2 and Slc19a3) on the plasma membrane import thiamine into the cell\n",
      "2. Thiamine is phosphorylated to thiamine diphosphate (TPP) by thiamine diphosphokinase (Tpk1) in the cytosol\n",
      "3. TPP is transported into mitochondria by the mitochondrial TPP transporter (Slc25a19)\n",
      "4. Thiamine triphosphate phosphatase (Thtpa) dephosphorylates thiamine triphosphate\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well supported by literature evidence and properly annotated with relevant PMIDs. The publications confirm:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The function of Slc19a2 and Slc19a3 as thiamine transporters\n",
      "- The role of Tpk1 in phosphorylating thiamine to thiamine diphosphate\n",
      "- The mitochondrial transport of thiamine diphosphate by Slc25a19\n",
      "- The thiamine triphosphate phosphatase activity of Thtpa\n",
      "\n",
      "## Review of Model Structure and GO-CAM Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices with:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper use of \"enabled by\" relationships**: Each activity is correctly annotated with the gene product that enables it\n",
      "2. **Proper cellular location**: Each activity is located in the appropriate cellular compartment\n",
      "3. **Proper use of causal relations**: Activities are connected with appropriate causal relations using \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413)\n",
      "4. **Appropriate evidence codes**: Experimental evidence codes (ECO:0000314 and ECO:0000315) are used with relevant PMIDs\n",
      "5. **Correct biological process associations**: All activities are part of the thiamine diphosphate biosynthetic process (GO:0009229)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains three causal relationships:\n",
      "1. Slc19a2 (thiamine transmembrane transporter) provides input for Tpk1 (thiamine diphosphokinase)\n",
      "2. Slc19a3 (another thiamine transmembrane transporter) provides input for Tpk1\n",
      "3. Thtpa (thiamine triphosphate phosphatase) provides input for Slc25a19 (thiamine pyrophosphate transmembrane transporter)\n",
      "\n",
      "The first two relationships make biological sense - thiamine transporters import thiamine, which is then a substrate for thiamine diphosphokinase. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the third causal relationship (from Thtpa to Slc25a19) appears problematic:\n",
      "- Thtpa dephosphorylates thiamine triphosphate to thiamine diphosphate (TPP)\n",
      "- Slc25a19 is a mitochondrial TPP transporter\n",
      "- The directionality suggests that the output of Thtpa is used by Slc25a19, but the literature doesn't clearly support this relationship\n",
      "- Based on the literature, Slc25a19 transports TPP into mitochondria, while Thtpa dephosphorylates thiamine triphosphate to TPP in the cytosol\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reconsider the causal relationship between Thtpa and Slc25a19**:\n",
      "   - The current relationship suggests Thtpa activity provides input for Slc25a19, but the direction of thiamine metabolism in cells suggests Slc25a19 activity should come after Tpk1 (which produces TPP) and before Thtpa.\n",
      "   - The model would be more accurate if restructured to show:\n",
      "     - Tpk1 (thiamine diphosphokinase) provides input for Slc25a19 (TPP transporter)\n",
      "     - Slc25a19 potentially provides input for other mitochondrial TPP-dependent enzymes (not currently in the model)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider adding other key enzymes in thiamine metabolism**:\n",
      "   - Thiamine pyrophosphokinase, which converts thiamine diphosphate to thiamine triphosphate (the substrate for Thtpa)\n",
      "   - TPP-dependent enzymes that use TPP as a cofactor (e.g., pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add annotations indicating the role of thiamine diphosphate as a cofactor**:\n",
      "   - The model currently focuses on the biosynthesis of TPP but doesn't capture its role as an essential cofactor for metabolic enzymes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Thiamine diphosphate biosynthetic process 2 (Mouse)\" (gomodel:6446bfcb00001243) presents a mostly accurate representation of thiamine transport and metabolism in mouse cells, with well-supported evidence from the literature. The model follows GO-CAM best practices in terms of structure and annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main issue is the questionable causal relationship between the thiamine triphosphate phosphatase (Thtpa) and the mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate transporter (Slc25a19), which doesn't seem to accurately reflect the sequence of events in thiamine metabolism based on the literature. Reorganizing this relationship and potentially adding more enzymes involved in thiamine metabolism would make the model more complete and biologically accurate.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "This model represents the process of autophagosome assembly in humans (NCBITaxon:9606), which is a key process in autophagy. The model includes multiple molecular activities involved in phagophore initiation, elongation, and autophagosome formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model provides a detailed representation of autophagosome assembly with 30+ activities involving key proteins like ULK1, ATG proteins, PI3K complex components, and LC3/GABARAP family proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate subcellular localization**: Activities are correctly localized to appropriate cellular components (phagophore assembly site, autophagosome membrane, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Well-evidenced assertions**: All activities have evidence codes and literature references supporting the annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal connectivity**: The model shows appropriate causal connections between activities (using RO:0002629 for direct positive regulation and RO:0002413 for providing input).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence code inconsistency**: \n",
      "   - In activity ID `gomodel:6446bfcb00001774/645d887900001734` (AMBRA1), the cellular location evidence references \"PMID:cytoplasm\" instead of a proper PMID. This should be corrected with a valid PMID reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Redundant causal connections**:\n",
      "   - Several activities have duplicate causal associations with the same predicate to the same downstream activity. For example:\n",
      "     - In activity ID `gomodel:6446bfcb00001774/645d887900001770` (BECN1), there are two identical causal associations to the same downstream activity.\n",
      "     - In activity ID `gomodel:6446bfcb00001774/646ff70100000384` (ATG4C), there are duplicate causal associations to activity `646ff70100000276`.\n",
      "   - These redundancies should be removed to maintain model clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing evidence in causal associations**:\n",
      "   - Several causal associations have empty evidence lists. For example:\n",
      "     - Activity ID `gomodel:6446bfcb00001774/645d887900001924` has a causal association with no evidence.\n",
      "     - Activity ID `gomodel:6446bfcb00001774/645d887900001755` has a causal association with empty evidence.\n",
      "   - All causal associations should have supporting evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular adaptor annotation improvement**:\n",
      "   - According to the molecular adaptor annotation guidelines, adaptors should have inputs specified through the \"has_input\" relation. However:\n",
      "     - Activity ID `gomodel:6446bfcb00001774/645d887900001770` (BECN1) with adaptor activity doesn't specify all its inputs.\n",
      "     - Activity ID `gomodel:6446bfcb00001774/646ff70100002442` (WIPI1) with adaptor activity correctly specifies CHEBI:58088 as input but may be missing other relevant inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Regulatory relationship representation**:\n",
      "   - The inhibitory activity of MTOR (P42345) on AMBRA1 is correctly represented with RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates), but there's a duplicate causal association that should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Complex representation**:\n",
      "   - For the PI3K complex involved in autophagosome assembly, the model correctly represents individual activities of proteins like BECN1 and PIK3C3 rather than using a complex identifier, which is appropriate since the individual activities are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Fix the evidence code \"PMID:cytoplasm\" in activity ID `gomodel:6446bfcb00001774/645d887900001734`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Remove redundant causal associations to improve model clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Add proper evidence to all causal associations that currently have empty evidence fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. For molecular adaptors (BECN1, WIPI1), ensure all relevant molecules they bring together are specified as inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Consider adding more information about the relationship between phospholipid binding activities and membrane recruitment in phagophore elongation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a comprehensive representation of autophagosome assembly in humans with good biological accuracy and evidence support. With the minor improvements suggested above, it will be an excellent resource for understanding autophagy regulation and autophagosome formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively captures the step-wise process of autophagosome assembly, from ULK1 kinase activity initiating the process to the conjugation of LC3/GABARAP family proteins to the autophagosome membrane, which is consistent with current knowledge of autophagy.\n",

      "## Model Summary\n",
      "This model represents the Coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway in mouse, including the enzymatic activities and transport steps required for CoA biosynthesis. The model includes multiple gene products, their molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships showing the flow of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the canonical CoA biosynthetic pathway, which consists of five enzymatic steps:\n",
      "1. Pantothenate kinase (PANK1/PANK2) - converts pantothenate to 4'-phosphopantothenate\n",
      "2. Phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS) - forms 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine\n",
      "3. Phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPCDC) - produces 4'-phosphopantetheine\n",
      "4. Pantetheine-phosphate adenylyltransferase activity (COASY) - forms dephospho-CoA\n",
      "5. Dephospho-CoA kinase activity (COASY) - produces the final CoA\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the model includes appropriate transporters:\n",
      "- SLC5A6 (pantothenate:sodium symporter)\n",
      "- SLC25A16 and SLC25A42 (mitochondrial transporters)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model accurately covers all key steps of CoA biosynthesis.\n",
      "2. **Proper causal connections**: The activities are connected with the appropriate \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) causal relation showing pathway flow.\n",
      "3. **Consistent cellular locations**: Each activity is appropriately localized (cytosol, mitochondrial membranes, etc.).\n",
      "4. **Well-evidenced annotations**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes (ECO terms) and references (PMIDs) for the assertions.\n",
      "5. **Proper regulation**: The model includes PDZD11 as an enzyme activator of SLC5A6.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing chemical entities**: While the activities are well-connected, the model doesn't explicitly show the metabolic intermediates as chemical entities. According to best practices, including the ChEBI terms for substrates and products would enhance the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Transporter annotations**: The transporters (SLC5A6, SLC25A16, SLC25A42) are included, but according to the transporter activity annotation guidelines, it would be ideal to explicitly represent:\n",
      "   - The specific molecules being transported\n",
      "   - The start and end locations of the transported molecules\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **COASY dual function**: The protein COASY (MGI:MGI:1918993) correctly has two separate activities (pantetheine-phosphate adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase) but it could be clearer that this is a bifunctional enzyme.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing \"occurs_in\" annotation**: Some activities don't have an \"occurs_in\" relation to specify their cellular location, though most do.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Limited pathway context**: While the biosynthetic pathway is well-represented, the model could benefit from connections to processes that utilize CoA.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Predicates**: The model correctly uses RO:0002413 (provides input for) to connect sequential activities in the pathway, and RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for the regulatory relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence codes**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes including:\n",
      "   - ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence)\n",
      "   - ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence)\n",

      "   - The taxon is listed as human (NCBITaxon:9606) but the title indicates this is a mouse model. This should be corrected to mouse (NCBITaxon:10090).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Integrin Complex Annotation**:\n",
      "   - The curator's comment \"Itgb1:Itga5 complex, how to annotate?\" suggests uncertainty about how to properly represent the integrin heterodimer.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Based on the complex annotation guidelines, since both Itga5 and Itgb1 are individually required for the receptor activity and the signaling is dependent on both, they can be individually annotated with the same molecular function (as done in this model with \"signaling receptor activity\" GO:0038023). This appears to be correctly implemented in the current model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Association Predicate**:\n",
      "   - The integrin receptor activities are linked to downstream IKK activities using the predicate RO:0002407 (\"provides input for\") rather than the more specific causal predicates like RO:0002629 (\"directly positively regulates\").\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Consider using more specific causal relationships such as \"directly positively regulates\" if the literature supports a direct regulatory relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **BCL2 Molecular Adaptor Function**:\n",
      "   - BCL2 is annotated with \"molecular adaptor activity\" (GO:0060090), which seems appropriate based on its role in this pathway as described in the paper, where it interacts with BECN1.\n",
      "   - However, its canonical role as an anti-apoptotic protein might be more familiar. The molecular adaptor annotation is focused on its specific role in this autophagy pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complex Representation**:\n",
      "   - While the model does not explicitly define an Itga5:Itgb1 complex, the individual components and their linked activities correctly represent the functional heterodimeric integrin receptor according to GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Literature Alignment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model aligns well with the key findings from PMID:36812915, which describes:\n",
      "1. Exercise-induced muscle secretion of FN1\n",

      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the FN1-integrin-autophagy signaling pathway described in the literature. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for most aspects, including annotation of molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Title:** Osteocalcin (bglap) hormone produced by osteoblasts binds Gprc6a receptor and regulates testosterone biosynthesis and male fertility (Mouse).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Taxon:** NCBITaxon:10090 (Mouse)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Status:** Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Components and Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents how the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin regulates male fertility through binding to the Gprc6a receptor, which leads to testosterone biosynthesis. The model includes four main activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Bglap (Osteocalcin)** - Hormone activity (GO:0005179) that occurs in extracellular region\n",
      "2. **Gprc6a receptor** - G protein-coupled receptor activity (GO:0004930) that occurs in plasma membrane\n",
      "3. **Ggcx** - Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity (GO:0008488)\n",
      "4. **Creb1** - DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0000981) that occurs in nucleus\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow in the model is:\n",
      "- Ggcx directly negatively regulates Bglap hormone activity\n",
      "- Bglap provides input for Gprc6a receptor activity\n",
      "- Gprc6a receptor activates Creb1 transcription factor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment of Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological pathway represented in this model is well-supported by scientific literature, particularly by the PMID:21333348 (Oury et al., 2011), which demonstrates that osteocalcin acts as a hormone that binds to the Gprc6a receptor in Leydig cells to promote testosterone production.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key findings from this paper that support the model include:\n",
      "- Osteocalcin is produced by osteoblasts and acts as a hormone that regulates male fertility\n",
      "- Uncarboxylated osteocalcin binds to the Gprc6a receptor on Leydig cells\n",
      "- This binding activates a cAMP signaling pathway that leads to CREB phosphorylation\n",
      "- CREB then regulates genes involved in testosterone biosynthesis\n",
      "- This pathway is specific to male fertility and does not affect female fertility\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the carboxylation of osteocalcin by gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (Ggcx), which negatively regulates osteocalcin's hormonal activity, as the uncarboxylated form is the active form of the hormone.\n",

      "\n",
      "The model follows the guidelines for signaling receptor activity:\n",
      "- Gprc6a (MGI:MGI:2429498) enables G protein-coupled receptor activity (GO:0004930)\n",
      "- It occurs in plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",

      "- It receives input from hormone osteocalcin\n",
      "- It has a causal relationship (RO:0002407) with the downstream transcription factor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Transcription factor activity annotation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows the guidelines for DNA-binding transcription factor activity:\n",
      "- Creb1 (MGI:MGI:88494) enables DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific (GO:0000981)\n",
      "- It occurs in nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "- It is part of regulation of testosterone biosynthetic process (GO:2000224)\n",

      "### Enzyme activity annotation\n",
      "\n",
      "The gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (Ggcx) activity is correctly annotated:\n",
      "- Ggcx (MGI:MGI:1927655) enables gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity (GO:0008488)\n",
      "- It is part of peptidyl-glutamic acid carboxylation (GO:0017187)\n",
      "- It directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) the hormone activity of osteocalcin, which is biologically accurate since carboxylation inhibits the hormone activity of osteocalcin\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence for the negative regulation relationship:**\n",
      "   While the model shows that Ggcx directly negatively regulates Bglap hormone activity, this causal association doesn't have any evidence information attached to it. It would be good to add appropriate evidence for this relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **More detailed molecular description:**\n",
      "   The model could be improved by adding more molecular details about how CREB1 regulates testosterone biosynthesis, particularly by showing which genes it regulates. The literature indicates that CREB regulates genes like StAR, Cyp11a, and 3beta-HSD, which are involved in testosterone biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular component for Ggcx:**\n",
      "   The cellular component for Ggcx activity is missing. According to UniProt, this enzyme is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, so a \"occurs_in\" relationship to the appropriate cellular component would improve the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the endocrine regulation of male fertility by the skeleton through osteocalcin, following the scientific evidence and GO-CAM best practices. The model captures the key biological entities and their relationships, with appropriate GO terms and evidence. The model is parsimonious and represents the pathway in a way that is easy to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only significant improvements would be adding evidence for the Ggcx negative regulation relationship, providing more detail on downstream gene regulation by CREB1, and including the cellular component for Ggcx activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "This model can be considered a high-quality representation of this biological pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This model describes a GPCR signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster that regulates epithelial tube formation through apical constriction. The model starts with Fog ligand activating Smog receptor, which leads to a cascade involving G-proteins (Concertina/Cta, Rho1), Rok kinase, and ultimately affecting Sqh to regulate apical constriction, a critical process for epithelial tube formation.\n",

      "## Pathway Flow\n",
      "1. Fog (FBgn0000719) → receptor ligand activity → extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "2. Directly positively regulates\n",

      "\n",
      "## Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. The overall signaling pathway follows the correct causal flow for a GPCR signaling pathway: ligand → receptor → G-protein activation → downstream effectors\n",
      "2. Appropriate molecular functions are assigned to each gene product\n",
      "3. All components are placed in the correct cellular locations\n",
      "4. Each step has evidence from relevant publications\n",
      "5. The model correctly incorporates G protein-coupled receptor signaling components according to guidelines\n",
      "6. The sequence follows established patterns from Drosophila GPCR signaling literature\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Suggestions for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Evidence on Final Causal Association**:\n",
      "   - The causal association from Rok to Sqh lacks evidence attribution. All other causal associations have appropriate evidence.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Add evidence from the papers cited elsewhere in the model (PMID:35876688 or other relevant publications) to this causal relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Location for Sqh**:\n",
      "   - Sqh doesn't have a cellular component annotation, unlike all other activities in the model.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Add the appropriate cellular component for Sqh, likely cytosol (GO:0005829) based on the pathway context.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological Process Annotation for Sqh**:\n",
      "   - Sqh is annotated as being part of apical constriction (GO:0003383), which is appropriate, but it would be helpful to also place it in the GPCR signaling pathway (GO:0007186) to maintain consistency with upstream components.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Consider adding GO:0007186 as a part_of biological process for Sqh.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Integration with Related Models**:\n",
      "   - According to PMID:35876688, Smog GPCR regulates distinct myosin pools in a ligand-dependent manner. If there are additional models that capture other aspects of Smog signaling, it would be valuable to link these models.\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Consider annotating any related models that capture other aspects of Smog GPCR function.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Validity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the GPCR signaling pathway described in the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PMID:35876688 provides evidence that Fog activates Smog to regulate Rho kinase accumulation and myosin activation during salivary gland invagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. PMID:26345366 provides support for the G-protein signaling components and their relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The pathway follows established patterns of GPCR signaling in Drosophila as described in the review paper, with the key steps of:\n",
      "   - Ligand binding to GPCR (Fog → Smog)\n",
      "   - GPCR activating G-proteins (Smog → Cta)\n",

      "   - Downstream signaling leading to cytoskeletal regulation (Rho1 → Rok → Sqh)\n",

      "4. The connection to apical constriction (GO:0003383) aligns with the biological outcome described in PMID:35876688.\n",

      "## Conformance with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows the guidelines for signaling receptor activity:\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the BMP7 signaling pathway leading to osteoblast differentiation in humans. The pathway begins with BMP7 (P18075) in the extracellular space, which initiates signaling through type II receptor ACVR2A (P27037) which then activates type I receptor ACVR1 (Q04771). This activation leads to transcription factor activation (SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD9) in the nucleus, ultimately regulating osteoblast differentiation genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correct pathway structure**: The model correctly represents the canonical BMP signaling pathway, where BMP7 acts as a growth factor that binds to and activates type II receptors, which then phosphorylate and activate type I receptors, which in turn phosphorylate SMADs that translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate molecular functions**: Each protein is annotated with the correct molecular function:\n",
      "   - BMP7 has \"growth factor activity\" (GO:0008083)\n",
      "   - ACVR2A has \"activin receptor activity, type II\" (GO:0016362)\n",
      "   - ACVR1 has \"activin receptor activity, type I\" (GO:0016361)\n",
      "   - SMAD proteins have transcription factor activities (GO:0000981, GO:0001228)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct cellular locations**: Each activity is properly localized:\n",
      "   - BMP7 in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "   - Receptors in plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - Transcription factors in nucleus (GO:0005634) or chromatin (GO:0000785)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Correct causal relationships**: The model uses the appropriate causal relationships between activities:\n",
      "   - BMP7 \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) ACVR2A, which aligns with the guidelines for protein ligand-activated signaling receptor pathways\n",
      "   - ACVR2A \"directly positively regulates\" ACVR1\n",
      "   - ACVR1 \"directly positively regulates\" the transcription factors\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Biological accuracy**: The model accurately represents the known biology of BMP7 signaling, consistent with the information from UniProt entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Biological Process annotation**: While all activities are correctly annotated as part of \"BMP signaling pathway\" (GO:0030509), there is no explicit representation of \"osteoblast differentiation\" (GO:0001649) despite it being mentioned in the title. This process should be included as a downstream effect of the transcription factor activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete representation of SMAD complex formation**: According to the UniProt entry for SMAD1, it forms a complex with SMAD4 which is crucial for nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. The model doesn't include SMAD4, which is an important part of the canonical BMP signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limited downstream effects**: The model stops at the transcription factors' activities without showing which specific genes they regulate to promote osteoblast differentiation. Including target genes would make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing evidence for some annotations**: While most activities have experimental evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence), some rely on sequence similarity or computational analysis. When available, direct experimental evidence would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add GO:0001649 (osteoblast differentiation) as a biological process that is causally downstream of the transcription factor activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Include SMAD4 and its interaction with SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD9 to form transcriptionally active complexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Expand the model to include specific target genes regulated by the SMAD transcription factors that are involved in osteoblast differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Check for additional direct experimental evidence for annotations that currently rely on sequence similarity or computational prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",

      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:645d887900000999 provides a solid representation of the BMP7 signaling pathway leading to transcription factor activation.

      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by evidence from various references:\n",
      "- PMID:37178686 - Used for evidence of CREB3L1's transcription factor activity and its role in activating CDKN1A\n",

      "\n",
      "## Adherence to GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate relationship predicates for causal connections between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular context**: Each activity correctly specifies cellular location with \"occurs_in\" relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Process context**: All activities are properly contextualized within the biological process \"mitotic G2 DNA damage checkpoint signaling\" using \"part_of\" relations.\n",

      "The biology represented in the model is consistent with current knowledge of the DNA damage response pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents that ATM kinase is activated upon DNA damage and initiates checkpoint signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The proteolytic processing of CREB3L1 by the site-1 and site-2 proteases (MBTPS1 and MBTPS2) is consistent with the literature (PMID:16417584), allowing CREB3L1 to act as a transcription factor.\n",

      "1. **Cell type specification**: Although the title mentions \"astrocytes,\" the model doesn't explicitly annotate this cell type context. Consider adding an explicit occurs_in relation to \"astrocyte\" (CL:0000127) for each activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **DNA damage stimulus**: Consider adding the initiating DNA damage as an input to the ATM activity to better represent the trigger of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular details**: The model could be expanded to include more molecular details about how ATM activates CREB3L1, as this is not fully clear from the current representation.\n",

      "# GO-CAM Review for Model: gomodel:645d887900001323\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Summary\n",
      "This model describes how 14-3-3 protein (YWHAE) sequesters ZNRF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, preventing it from ubiquitylating ATP1A1 (Na+/K+ ATPase alpha-1 subunit), thus allowing ATP1A1 to function at the plasma membrane. The model includes PKA (PRKACA) as an upstream kinase that phosphorylates 14-3-3, activating its sequestering function.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is based on research by Hoxhaj et al. (2012), which establishes that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ZNRF2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the Na+/K+ ATPase α1 subunit (ATP1A1) for ubiquitylation\n",
      "2. When phosphorylated, ZNRF2 binds to 14-3-3 proteins and is released into the cytosol\n",
      "3. This release prevents ZNRF2 from ubiquitylating ATP1A1, thus maintaining ATP1A1 activity at the plasma membrane\n",
      "4. Several kinases, including PKA, can phosphorylate ZNRF2, leading to 14-3-3 binding\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Structure Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four main activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **PRKACA (P17612)** - protein serine kinase activity (GO:0106310) occurring in cytoplasm\n",
      "2. **YWHAE (P62258)** - protein sequestering activity (GO:0140311) occurring in cytoplasm\n",
      "3. **ZNRF2 (Q8NHG8)** - ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) occurring in intracellular membrane-bounded organelle\n",
      "4. **ATP1A1 (P05023)** - ATP hydrolysis activity (GO:0016887) occurring at plasma membrane\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships in the model are:\n",
      "- PRKACA provides input for YWHAE (RO:0002413)\n",
      "- YWHAE directly negatively regulates ZNRF2 (RO:0002630)\n",
      "- ZNRF2 directly negatively regulates ATP1A1 (RO:0002630)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Positive Aspects\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the biological pathway described in the literature\n",
      "2. The molecular functions assigned to proteins are appropriate\n",
      "3. The causal relationships are logical and well-supported by evidence\n",
      "4. The cellular locations for activities are correctly specified\n",
      "5. The model includes appropriate biological processes for each activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence Code Issue**: \n",
      "   - For PRKACA providing input for YWHAE, there appears to be a duplicate evidence entry (same evidence used twice)\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Remove the duplicate evidence entry\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Information about Phosphorylation Sites**:\n",
      "   - While the literature indicates ZNRF2 is phosphorylated at specific sites (Ser19, Ser82, Ser145), which facilitates 14-3-3 binding, this level of molecular detail is not captured\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Consider adding annotations about the specific phosphorylation sites if support for this level of detail is added to GO-CAM in the future\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mechanistic Detail**:\n",
      "   - The model doesn't capture that ZNRF2 is N-myristoylated, which targets it to membranes, and phosphorylation counteracts this, causing cytoplasmic localization\n",
      "   - Recommendation: This level of mechanistic detail might be beyond GO-CAM's current scope, but could be considered for future enhancements\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex Formation**:\n",
      "   - The interaction between 14-3-3 and phosphorylated ZNRF2 forming a complex isn't explicitly modeled\n",
      "   - Recommendation: Following GO-CAM guidelines for complexes, the current approach (using sequestering activity) is appropriate since the sequestering function is well-defined\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:645d887900001323) provides a clear and accurate representation of how 14-3-3 proteins regulate ZNRF2 activity, thereby affecting Na+/K+ ATPase function. The model is consistent with the published literature and follows GO-CAM best practices. The only minor issue is a duplicated evidence entry for one causal relationship, which could be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully captures the key aspects of this regulatory pathway in a parsimonious way that would be understandable to other researchers. The cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes are appropriately assigned, and the causal relationships accurately reflect current knowledge of the pathway.\n",

      "   - PIK3R1 (P27986) is appropriately annotated with phosphatidylinositol kinase activity (GO:0052742).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Relationships**:\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Inflammatory Cytokine Production**:\n",
      "   The model could potentially include the end result of this pathway - the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which are important outcomes of this signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **LPS as Stimulus**:\n",
      "   The model could explicitly represent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as the activating stimulus for this pathway, as ZNRF1 was shown to interact with CAV1 in response to LPS.\n",

      "\n",
      "The model accurately depicts the coenzyme A catabolic pathway based on the literature evidence provided. I examined the referenced papers and found that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Vnn1 (vanin 1) acts as a pantetheine hydrolase that cleaves pantetheine to pantothenate and cysteamine (PMID:11042271). This matches the model's representation with pantetheine (CHEBI:16753) as input and pantothenate (CHEBI:29032) and cysteaminium (CHEBI:58029) as outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Pank4 is shown as having phosphatase activity acting on phosphopantetheine (CHEBI:61723) to produce pantetheine (CHEBI:16753). This is supported by PMID:35896750, which describes PANK4 as a phosphatase that can dephosphorylate 4'-phosphopantetheine.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Alpi (alkaline phosphatase, intestinal) is represented as having phosphatase activity that converts 3'-dephospho-CoA (CHEBI:57328) to phosphopantetheine (CHEBI:57287). This is supported by PMID:6619987 and PMID:16742561, which document the ability of alkaline phosphatases to hydrolyze phosphomonoesters and pyrophosphates.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Enpp1 has pyrophosphatase activity that converts coenzyme A (CHEBI:57287) to 3'-dephospho-CoA (CHEBI:57328). This is supported by PMID:7678057, which describes the nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity of Enpp1.\n",

      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "I checked the GO-CAM model against best practice guidelines for complex annotation:\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the [How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM](https://bioregistry.io/GO:0015938) guidelines, when the subunit that carries the molecular activity is known, the complex is not described and the activity is represented by the specific protein carrying the activity. This model follows this practice correctly by annotating each individual protein with its specific enzymatic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model also follows the practice of connecting activities using causal relations (RO:0002413 \"provides input for\"), indicating the correct flow of substrates and products in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and Provenance\n",
      "\n",
      "Each activity annotation is supported with appropriate evidence codes and references:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Vnn1 - ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) with PMID:11042271\n",
      "2. Pank4 - ECO:0000266 (sequence orthology evidence) with PMID:35896750 and UniProtKB:Q9NVE7\n",
      "3. Alpi - ECO:0000266 (sequence orthology evidence) with PMID:16742561 and UniProtKB:P10696\n",
      "4. Enpp1 - ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) with PMID:7678057\n",
      "\n",
      "All annotations include proper provenance information with contributor ORCID and dates, which is in line with GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is scientifically accurate and follows GO-CAM best practices, I have a few suggestions for enhancement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Subcellular localization**: The model could be enhanced by including cellular component annotations for each activity. For example, Vnn1 is known to be a GPI-anchored ectoenzyme, and Enpp1 is a membrane protein. Adding this information would provide a more complete spatial context for the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regulatory relationships**: If known, regulatory relationships between activities (positive or negative regulation) could be added to make the model more comprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional chemical participants**: While the main substrates and products are included, some intermediates or cofactors could be added for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connection to related processes**: Linking this catabolic pathway to related metabolic processes such as pantothenate metabolism or coenzyme A biosynthesis would provide a broader context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model 645d887900001551 \"Coenzyme A catabolic process 2 (Mouse)\" is a well-constructed model that accurately represents the coenzyme A catabolic pathway in mouse. It adheres to GO-CAM best practices for pathway representation and provides appropriate evidence for each annotation.\n",
      "\n",

      "Now I need to check the GO term definition directly. Let me look at the model in more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my review of the GO-CAM model \"Canonical mTORC1 signaling (Human)\" with ID gomodel:646ff70100000391, I'll provide a comprehensive assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview:\n",
      "This model represents the canonical mTORC1 (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1) signaling pathway in human cells. It describes how various proteins and complexes interact to regulate mTOR kinase activity, which ultimately controls protein synthesis and translation through multiple downstream effectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure Review:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model captures the key components of the canonical mTORC1 pathway, including the Ragulator complex, Rag GTPases, RHEB, mTOR, and downstream effectors (RPS6KB1/2, EIF4EBP1, RPS6).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct cellular localization**: Activities are properly localized to the lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765) where mTORC1 signaling occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper causality**: The causal relationships between activities are well-represented using appropriate predicates (mostly RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\").\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate evidence**: Each activity and causal relationship is supported by scientific literature references (PMIDs).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complete pathway representation**: The model covers upstream activators (Ragulator complex, Rag GTPases, RHEB) through downstream effectors (RPS6KB1/2, EIF4EBP1) to the final outcome (translation regulation).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex annotation**: The Ragulator complex (GO:0071986) is correctly used when the specific subunit carrying the guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity is unknown. However, the model does not specify the members of this complex. According to the complex annotation guidelines, members can be indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **RPTOR annotation**: RPTOR (Q8N122) has \"enzyme-substrate adaptor activity\" (GO:0140767) and positively regulates mTOR (P42345) kinase activity. This aligns with its known function as a regulatory-associated protein of mTOR that serves as a scaffold. However, based on adaptor activity guidelines, it might be beneficial to specify what specific molecules it is bringing together using \"has input\" relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Representation of EIF4E**: While EIF4EBP1 (Q13541) is included with its translation repressor activity, the model doesn't explicitly show how mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 relieves inhibition of EIF4E (P06730). EIF4E is listed in the objects but not as an active participant.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Nutrient sensing upstream**: While the model includes the lysosomal-based activation of mTORC1, it could potentially include more details about how amino acid levels are sensed and signal to the Rag GTPases.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model follows the GO-CAM practice of representing activities connected by causal relationships.\n",
      "2. Each activity is properly contextualized with molecular function, biological process, and cellular component.\n",
      "3. Evidence is provided for each assertion.\n",
      "4. Complex usage follows the guidelines in \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document.\n",
      "5. Adaptor protein annotation generally follows the \"Molecular adaptor activity\" guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider explicitly representing the members of the Ragulator complex.\n",
      "2. Add \"has input\" relationships for adaptor activities to clearly indicate which molecules are being brought together.\n",
      "3. Consider adding EIF4E as an active participant to complete the translation initiation regulation part of the pathway.\n",
      "4. Perhaps expand the model to include upstream nutrient sensing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Consider adding a brief description or comments that explain the overall biological significance of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary:\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the canonical mTORC1 signaling pathway in humans. It captures the key molecular activities and their causal relationships, with proper evidence and cellular context. The model successfully demonstrates how mTOR kinase activation leads to the regulation of protein synthesis through multiple downstream effectors. With a few minor enhancements as suggested, this model would be even more comprehensive and informative.\n",

      "2. RagA/RRAGA protein-membrane adaptor activity\n",
      "3. RNF152 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity\n",
      "4. GATOR1 complex GTPase activator activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships show:\n",
      "- RagA/RRAGA GTP binding directly positively regulates RagA/RRAGA protein-membrane adaptor activity\n",
      "- RNF152 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity directly positively regulates GATOR1 complex GTPase activator activity\n",
      "- GATOR1 complex GTPase activator activity directly negatively regulates RagA/RRAGA GTP binding activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation of the Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. RagA/RRAGA activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents two activities of RagA/RRAGA:\n",
      "- **GTP binding (GO:0005525)**: This is correctly located at the lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765) and is part of the positive regulation of TORC1 signaling (GO:1904263).\n",
      "- **Protein-membrane adaptor activity (GO:0043495)**: This is also correctly located at the lysosomal membrane and is part of protein localization to lysosome (GO:0061462).\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationship between these activities (RO:0002629 - \"directly positively regulates\") is biologically accurate, as GTP binding by RagA enables its function as a membrane adaptor that helps recruit mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. RNF152 activity:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)**: This is correctly located at the lysosomal membrane and is part of protein K63-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070534).\n",
      "\n",
      "The literature evidence (PMID:25936802) supports that RNF152 is a lysosome-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of RagA.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. GATOR1 complex activity:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **GTPase activator activity (GO:0005096)**: This is correctly located at the lysosomal membrane and is part of the negative regulation of TORC1 signaling (GO:1904262).\n",
      "\n",
      "The literature evidence (PMID:29590090) supports that GATOR1 functions as a GAP for RagA, stimulating its GTPase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents that:\n",
      "- RNF152 ubiquitin ligase activity positively regulates GATOR1 GAP activity (RO:0002629)\n",
      "- GATOR1 GAP activity negatively regulates RagA GTP binding (RO:0002630)\n",
      "\n",
      "These relationships are supported by the evidence that ubiquitination of RagA by RNF152 promotes the recruitment of GATOR1, which then stimulates GTP hydrolysis by RagA, converting it to its inactive GDP-bound state.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Comparison with Literature Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the cited literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **PMID:31601764** and **PMID:31601708** demonstrate that RagA binds GTP and functions in mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes through protein-membrane adaptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **PMID:25936802** establishes that:\n",
      "   - RNF152 targets RagA for K63-linked polyubiquitination\n",
      "   - This ubiquitination occurs at four lysine residues (K142, K220, K230, K244)\n",
      "   - Ubiquitination promotes the binding of GATOR1 to RagA\n",
      "   - This process inhibits mTORC1 activation\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **PMID:29590090** confirms that GATOR1:\n",
      "   - Functions as a GAP for RagA\n",
      "   - Stimulates GTP hydrolysis by RagA\n",
      "   - Negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Completeness**: The model captures the key molecular activities and causal relationships described in the literature.\n",
      "2. **Evidence**: All components are supported by appropriate literature evidence.\n",
      "3. **Cellular location**: The lysosomal membrane localization is consistently represented for all activities.\n",
      "4. **Biological process context**: Relevant biological processes (mTORC1 signaling, ubiquitination) are incorporated appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Improvements:\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: The model uses GO:1990130 (GATOR1 complex) as the enabler of the GTPase activator activity, which is appropriate according to the GO-CAM guidelines for complexes when the specific subunit carrying the activity is not explicitly known. However, the model could potentially be expanded to include the specific subunits of GATOR1 (DEPDC5, NPRL2, and NPRL3) if their specific roles in GAP activity were to be annotated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional regulatory components**: The model could potentially be expanded to include:\n",
      "   - The role of amino acid sensing in regulating RNF152-RagA interaction\n",
      "   - The involvement of deubiquitinating enzymes (like DUB3 mentioned in PMID:25936802)\n",
      "   - The interaction with the Ragulator complex\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **RagC representation**: The model focuses on RagA, but RagA functions as a heterodimer with RagC. The model could potentially include RagC's role, particularly as RagA-RagC heterodimer nucleotide states are critical for mTORC1 regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows the GO-CAM best practices for complex annotation. As described in the document \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\":\n",
      "- When the subunit carrying the molecular activity is not known, using the GO accession for the complex (as done for GATOR1 in this model) is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model 646ff70100000611 accurately represents the biological mechanism by which RNF152 ubiquitinates RagA to regulate mTORC1 signaling through GATOR1. The model includes the essential molecular activities, causal relationships, and cellular contexts supported by the literature. \n",
      "\n",
      "While there are opportunities for expansion to include additional components of this regulatory pathway, the current representation provides a clear and accurate depiction of the core mechanism. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities and complex annotations.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overview of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the inhibitory mechanism of the GATOR1 complex on mTORC1 signaling in humans. The model specifically focuses on how GATOR1 functions as a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) for the Rag GTPases to inactivate mTORC1 signaling in response to amino acid deprivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents the current understanding of mTORC1 regulation by the GATOR1 complex:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The GATOR1 complex (represented by NPRL2 - [UniProtKB:Q8WTW4](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q8WTW4)) functions as a GTPase activator protein (GO:0005096) for RagA/RagC GTPases.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Rag GTPases (RagA/RagC heterodimer) act as a molecular switch that recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface in the presence of amino acids, where it can be activated by Rheb.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. RRAGC ([UniProtKB:Q9HB90](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q9HB90)) is correctly shown to have protein-membrane adaptor activity (GO:0043495) and GDP binding activity (GO:0019003), which aligns with its known function.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. RHEB ([UniProtKB:Q15382](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q15382)) is properly represented with protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity (GO:0043539) that activates mTOR.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The causal links between activities correctly show that GATOR1 negatively regulates RagC through its GTPase activator activity, which then affects mTORC1 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. All activities are correctly localized to the lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765), which is the known site of mTORC1 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular mechanisms**: The model correctly shows how GATOR1 acts as a GAP for Rag GTPases, which is supported by the scientific literature (PMID:35338845, PMID:31601708).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper causal connections**: The causal relationships between the activities are appropriately represented with the \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) and \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630) predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Accurate cellular localization**: All activities are correctly localized to the lysosomal membrane, which is essential for understanding the spatial regulation of mTORC1 signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper use of complex annotation**: Following GO-CAM best practices for complex annotation, the model uses specific protein components when the activities are known (e.g., NPRL2's GTPase activator activity) and the GO term for the KICSTOR complex (GO:0140007) when the specific subunit carrying the activity is not known.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Well-supported evidence**: The model provides strong evidence for each assertion with appropriate PMIDs and evidence codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Issues and Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional pathway context**: While the model does an excellent job representing the GATOR1 inhibition of mTORC1, it could be enhanced by including more upstream regulation of GATOR1 (such as GATOR2 or amino acid sensors like SESN1/2/3) to provide more context for when this inhibition occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complete GATOR1 complex composition**: The model currently shows NPRL2, but could be improved by explicitly showing the other components of GATOR1 (DEPDC5, NPRL3) with their specific roles, if known.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream effectors**: The model could be expanded to include more downstream targets of mTORC1 beyond S6K1 and 4E-BP1 to better represent the broader impact of this signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of how the GATOR1 complex inhibits mTORC1 signaling in response to amino acid deprivation. The model uses appropriate GO terms, follows best practices for complex annotation, provides strong evidence, and correctly represents the causal relationships between molecular activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the literature, including recent structural studies (PMID:35338845) that elucidate how GATOR1 functions as a GAP for Rag GTPases. It is well-constructed, parsimonious, and effectively communicates the key aspects of this important regulatory pathway in a way that is accessible to human readers while maintaining biological accuracy.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This model represents the inhibition of canonical mTORC1 signaling through the ubiquitination and degradation of LAMTOR1 by UBE3A in humans. The model shows how UBE3A-mediated degradation of LAMTOR1 affects the Ragulator complex function and subsequently impacts TORC1 signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key components and relationships:\n",
      "1. **UBE3A (Q05086)** - E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "2. **LAMTOR1 (Q6IAA8)** - Ragulator complex protein with protein-membrane adaptor activity (GO:0043495)\n",
      "3. **Ragulator complex (GO:0071986)** - Guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity (GO:0005085)\n",

      "### Causal relationships:\n",
      "- UBE3A directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) LAMTOR1's protein-membrane adaptor activity\n",
      "- LAMTOR1's protein-membrane adaptor activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) the Ragulator complex's guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Control Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "✅ The biological content aligns with published literature, particularly with the 2018 paper (PMID:30020076) which demonstrated that UBE3A ubiquitinates LAMTOR1, leading to its proteasomal degradation, affecting mTORC1 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "✅ **Appropriate use of complexes**: The model correctly uses the Ragulator complex (GO:0071986) as the bearer of the guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity since the specific subunit carrying this activity isn't known, following the guidelines in \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\".\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ **Appropriate causal relationships**: The model uses correct causal relationship predicates (RO:0002630 for negative regulation and RO:0002629 for positive regulation).\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ **Evidence attribution**: All activities have appropriate evidence codes and PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ **Cellular component accuracy**: LAMTOR1 and the Ragulator complex are correctly located at the lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765), which matches the UniProt subcellular location data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas of Strength\n",
      "1. The model accurately captures the negative regulation of LAMTOR1 by UBE3A through ubiquitination, which is supported by experimental evidence.\n",
      "2. The model correctly represents the Ragulator complex's role in TORC1 signaling and how it's affected by LAMTOR1 degradation.\n",
      "3. The cellular locations are accurately represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "1. **Completeness of pathway**: The model could potentially be expanded to include downstream effects on mTORC1 activation and subsequent cellular processes like synaptic plasticity, as indicated in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Representation of ubiquitination process**: While the model shows UBE3A negatively regulating LAMTOR1, it could explicitly represent the ubiquitination process and proteasomal degradation as intermediate steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:[646ff70100001877](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:646ff70100001877)) is biologically accurate and follows GO-CAM best practices. It correctly represents the UBE3A-mediated inhibition of LAMTOR1 and its impact on the Ragulator complex, which affects mTORC1 signaling. The model uses appropriate evidence codes, causal relationships, and cellular component annotations.\n",

      "The GO-CAM model (646ff70100002308) titled \"SMAD6 arginine methylation inhibits SMAD1 signaling (Human)\" represents a key molecular pathway in the regulation of BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) signaling in humans.

      "## Evidence Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by evidence from multiple publications, with the primary evidence coming from [PMID:33667543](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33667543/), which specifically investigates how arginine methylation of R81 in SMAD6 confines BMP-induced SMAD1 signaling. All activities and causal relationships are backed by experimental evidence (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular representation**: The model correctly captures the mechanism by which PRMT1 methylates SMAD6, enabling it to sequester SMAD1 and prevent SMAD1-SMAD4 complex formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence-based annotations**: All associations are supported by appropriate evidence codes and references to primary literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complete pathway representation**: The model includes the initiating signal (BMP4), the key regulatory mechanism (SMAD6 methylation by PRMT1), and the downstream effects (inhibition of SMAD1-SMAD4 complex formation).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper subcellular localization**: The model correctly indicates the subcellular localization of each activity (extracellular space for BMP4, cytoplasm for PRMT1 and SMAD6, nucleus for SMAD1 and SMAD4).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The causal relationships between activities are correctly represented using appropriate relation ontology terms (RO:0002407, RO:0002629, RO:0012010, RO:0002629).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Specific methylation site**: While the model title specifies arginine methylation, the specific methylation site (R81) described in the literature could be captured more explicitly in the model. Based on the referenced PMID, SMAD6 is methylated specifically at arginine 81 (R81), which is crucial for its ability to bind to phosphorylated SMAD1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **BMP receptor interaction**: The model could be expanded to include the interaction of BMP4 with its receptors (BMPR1A/BMPR2), which is the initial step in activating the signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **SMAD1 phosphorylation**: The model doesn't explicitly capture the phosphorylation of SMAD1 by the BMP receptor, which is a critical step that makes SMAD1 a target for SMAD6-mediated sequestration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Nuclear translocation**: While the model indicates the nuclear localization of SMAD1 and SMAD4, it doesn't explicitly represent the inhibition of SMAD1 nuclear translocation by SMAD6, which is an important aspect of the regulatory mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes and molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity representation**: Activities are appropriately represented with specific molecular functions enabled by specific gene products.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The causal relationships between activities are correctly specified using appropriate relation ontology terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular context**: All activities are placed in their appropriate cellular contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence support**: All annotations are supported by appropriate evidence codes and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:646ff70100002308) provides an accurate and well-supported representation of how SMAD6 arginine methylation by PRMT1 inhibits SMAD1 signaling in the BMP pathway. The model is consistent with current knowledge about this regulatory mechanism and follows GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be enhanced by explicitly representing the specific methylation site (R81), including BMP receptor interactions, capturing SMAD1 phosphorylation, and representing the inhibition of SMAD1 nuclear translocation. However, these suggestions do not detract from the overall quality and accuracy of the existing model.\n",

      "\n",
      "The causal flow is logically constructed and follows the expected biological pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. LAMTOR1 → Ragulator complex (RO:0002629, directly positively regulates)\n",

      "7. RPTOR → mTOR (RO:0002629)\n",
      "8. mTOR → ULK1 (RO:0002630, directly negatively regulates)\n",
      "\n",
      "This causal flow correctly represents the signaling cascade where Ragulator and Rag GTPases facilitate recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomes, RHEB activates mTOR kinase activity, and mTOR phosphorylates ULK1 to inhibit autophagy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Locations\n",
      "\n",
      "The cellular locations are accurately represented:\n",

      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Annotation**: The model correctly uses complex annotation practices based on \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\":\n",
      "   - It appropriately uses the Ragulator complex (GO:0071986) ID for guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity since the exact subunit carrying this activity is not known\n",
      "   - LAMTOR1 is properly annotated with its specific activity separate from the complex\n",
      "   - mTORC1 is appropriately represented with RPTOR and mTOR having distinct activities\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Relationships**: The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) and RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) to represent the signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subcellular Locations**: Each activity is annotated with appropriate subcellular locations.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological Process Annotations**: The model appropriately includes biological process annotations for most activities, but could benefit from more specific autophagy-related process terms for the ULK1 component.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Completeness**: While the core signaling pathway is well represented, additional downstream effects of ULK1 inhibition could be included to provide a more complete picture of autophagy regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clarity and Parsimony**: The model is relatively clean and easy to follow, but adding one or two key additional outputs of activated ULK1 when not inhibited by mTOR would help clarify the biological consequences of this regulation.\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model effectively represents the negative regulation of autophagy through mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1.

      "- **ID**: [gomodel:646ff70100004025](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:646ff70100004025)\n",
      "- **Title**: Activation of the canonical mTORC1 signaling via non-catalytic deubiquitination of RPTOR by OTUB1 (Human)\n",

      "- **Status**: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the mechanism by which OTUB1 stabilizes Raptor (RPTOR) protein through non-catalytic deubiquitination, leading to activation of mTORC1 signaling. The model is based primarily on evidence from the publication by Seo et al. (PMID:35927303), which demonstrates that phosphorylation of OTUB1 at tyrosine 26 (Y26) by Src and SRMS kinases is critical for its interaction with Raptor, preventing Raptor's ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### Main Findings Represented:\n",
      "The model correctly captures the key pathway where:\n",
      "1. Src and SRMS kinases (SRC and SRMS proteins) phosphorylate OTUB1 at Y26\n",
      "2. Phosphorylated OTUB1 inhibits ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBE2N, UBE2W, UBE2D1) \n",
      "3. This inhibition prevents Raptor (RPTOR) ubiquitination and degradation\n",
      "4. Stabilized Raptor maintains mTORC1 signaling activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Functions and Biological Processes:\n",
      "The model accurately represents:\n",
      "- Protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713) for SRC and SRMS\n",
      "- Ubiquitin-protein transferase inhibitor activity (GO:0055105) for OTUB1\n",
      "- Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme activity (GO:0061631) for UBE2N, UBE2W, and UBE2D1\n",
      "- Enzyme-substrate adaptor activity (GO:0140767) for RPTOR\n",
      "- Protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) for MTOR\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships:\n",
      "The model uses appropriate causal relation predicates:\n",
      "- RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates): For positive regulatory relationships\n",
      "- RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates): For OTUB1 inhibition of E2 enzymes\n",
      "- RO:0002409: An unexpected relation that may need review\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Control Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. The model accurately captures the non-canonical mechanism of OTUB1's deubiquitinase activity\n",
      "2. The relationships between proteins are well-supported by experimental evidence\n",
      "3. The model includes appropriate cellular localization (lysosomal membrane)\n",
      "4. Evidence is properly cited with direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues Identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Predicate Usage Issue**: The model uses RO:0002409 in several causal associations from ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to RPTOR. This doesn't appear in your list of standard predicates for causal associations. This should be replaced with one of the standard causal relations, likely RO:0002305 (causally upstream of, negative effect) as these enzymes promote Raptor degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Component Annotation**: While RPTOR and MTOR are correctly annotated as occurring in the lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765), there's no cellular component annotation for OTUB1, SRC, SRMS, or the E2 enzymes. According to the paper, their interactions are likely cytosolic and the paper discusses their localization.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mechanistic Detail**: The model doesn't capture the specific ubiquitination sites on Raptor (K774 and K789) that were identified in the paper. While this level of detail may exceed what's typically included in GO-CAMs, it could be noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing Activity Terms**: The paper describes that phosphorylation of OTUB1 at Y26 is critical for its function, but the model doesn't capture this post-translational modification state of OTUB1.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Literature Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the cited literature (PMID:35927303). The paper demonstrates that OTUB1 stabilizes Raptor in a non-canonical manner, where phosphorylation at Y26 is critical for the interaction between OTUB1 and Raptor. The paper also identifies that Src and SRMS kinases induce this phosphorylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fix Predicate Usage**: Replace RO:0002409 with the standard RO:0002305 (causally upstream of, negative effect) in the causal associations from ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to RPTOR.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Cellular Components**: Add appropriate cellular component annotations for OTUB1, SRC, SRMS, and the E2 enzymes based on information in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider Adding a Complex**: According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, when activities of specific subunits are known (as in this case), they should be represented individually. However, it might be helpful to indicate that RPTOR and MTOR form part of the mTORC1 complex for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Annotate Post-Translational Modifications**: Consider adding an annotation to capture the phosphorylation state of OTUB1 that is critical for its function in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Check for Missing Connections**: The model correctly shows that OTUB1 inhibits the E2 enzymes, but it could be clearer about how these enzymes affect RPTOR - perhaps by adding a direct connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the biological mechanism described in the literature. With the minor improvements suggested above, it would provide an even clearer representation of how OTUB1 regulates mTORC1 signaling through Raptor stabilization. The model effectively captures the non-canonical deubiquitination mechanism and the key regulatory role of tyrosine phosphorylation, which is consistent with the supporting publication.\n",

      "## Main Components and Activities\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following key proteins and activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **AKT1S1/PRAS40 (Q96B36)**: Functions as a protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor (GO:0030291), negatively regulating mTORC1 signaling (GO:1904262)\n",

      "   - As part of positive regulation of translational initiation (GO:0045948)\n",

      "3. **RPS6KB1/S6K1 (P23443)** and **RPS6KB2/S6K2 (Q9UBS0)**: Both exhibit protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **RPS6/S6 (P62753)**: Structural constituent of ribosome (GO:0003735), involved in cytoplasmic translation (GO:0002181)\n",

      "5. **EIF4EBP1 (Q13541)**: Translation repressor activity (GO:0030371), involved in negative regulation of translational initiation (GO:0045947)\n",

      "## Regulatory Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively captures several causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. AKT1S1/PRAS40 **directly negatively regulates** (RO:0002630) mTOR kinase activity\n",
      "2. mTOR **directly positively regulates** (RO:0002629) RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2\n",
      "3. RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 **directly positively regulate** (RO:0002629) RPS6\n",
      "4. mTOR **directly negatively regulates** (RO:0002630) EIF4EBP1\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment and QC\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate biological content**: The model accurately represents the inhibitory role of AKT1S1/PRAS40 on mTORC1 signaling in the absence of insulin, which is supported by the literature (PMID:29750193, PMID:17386266). According to the UniProt entry for AKT1S1 (Q96B36), it is indeed \"a negative regulator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)\" that \"in absence of insulin and nutrients, associates with the mTORC1 complex and directly inhibits mTORC1 activity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct molecular functions**: The model accurately assigns molecular functions to the proteins involved:\n",
      "   - AKT1S1 as a protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor\n",
      "   - mTOR as a protein serine/threonine kinase\n",
      "   - S6K1/S6K2 as protein serine/threonine kinases\n",
      "   - RPS6 as a structural component of the ribosome\n",
      "   - EIF4EBP1 as a translation repressor\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular localization information**: The model includes information about cellular localization where relevant (e.g., RPS6 is annotated as occurring in the cytosolic ribosome, and mTOR is noted as occurring in the lysosomal membrane).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper use of causal relationships**: The model uses the appropriate causal relationship predicates (RO:0002629 for direct positive regulation and RO:0002630 for direct negative regulation).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence support**: All activities and relationships are backed by appropriate evidence (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence) and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorporate additional context**: The model could be expanded to include the response to insulin stimulation to provide a more comprehensive view of the pathway's regulation. Currently, it only represents the situation in the absence of insulin.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular details of inhibition**: The model could potentially benefit from more detail on how exactly AKT1S1/PRAS40 inhibits mTOR - from the literature, we know it blocks the mTOR substrate-recruitment site (PMID:29236692).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Phosphorylation regulation**: The model doesn't explicitly capture how phosphorylation of AKT1S1/PRAS40 (particularly at Thr-246) affects its inhibitory function. From UniProt: \"Phosphorylation at Thr-246 by AKT1 relieves its inhibitory function on mTORC1.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex representation**: While the model mentions mTORC1 in the process context, it doesn't explicitly represent the mTORC1 complex as a whole. Based on the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, since the activity is enabled by mTOR specifically (the subunit carrying the activity is known), this approach is acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model 646ff70100004220 is a high-quality representation of AKT1S1/PRAS40's inhibitory role in mTORC1 signaling in the absence of insulin. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities, causal relationships, and regulatory mechanisms. It accurately represents the biological reality as supported by the literature and is constructed in a way that is easy to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be enhanced by extending it to show the dynamic regulation that occurs in response to insulin stimulation, which leads to phosphorylation of AKT1S1/PRAS40 and its dissociation from mTORC1. This would provide a more comprehensive view of this signaling pathway's regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this model is a valuable contribution to the GO-CAM knowledge base and serves as a good example of how to represent regulatory relationships in signaling pathways.\n",

      "   - Predicate: RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates)\n",

      "\n",
      "## Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate biological pathway representation**: The model correctly represents the established mTORC1 signaling pathway in response to starvation, with TSC2 inhibiting RHEB, which in turn regulates mTORC1 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate evidence**: Each activity and causal relationship is supported by published literature with direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct subcellular localization**: Key components like TSC2, RHEB, and mTOR are correctly localized to the lysosomal membrane, which is consistent with current understanding of mTORC1 regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal predicates (RO:0002629 for positive regulation and RO:0002630 for negative regulation) to represent the relationships between components.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Correct molecular functions**: Each protein is assigned appropriate molecular functions based on their established biochemical activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, mTORC1 could be more clearly represented as a complex. The model currently represents mTOR but does not explicitly include RAPTOR and mLST8, which are core components of the mTORC1 complex. According to the literature (PMID:29236692), mTORC1 is a ~1 MDa dimeric complex consisting of mTOR, RAPTOR, and mLST8.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing components**: The model doesn't include RAPTOR, which is crucial for substrate recognition through its binding to the TOS motif present in substrates like 4E-BP1 and S6K1. PMID:29236692 shows that RAPTOR binds to substrates through a TOS motif, which is an important aspect of mTORC1 substrate specificity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional regulatory inputs**: The model focuses on TSC2-mediated regulation of mTORC1 in response to starvation, but doesn't include other regulatory inputs such as PRAS40, which is an mTORC1 inhibitor mentioned in PMID:29236692.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Mechanistic details**: The model could include more mechanistic details about how RHEB activates mTORC1. According to PMID:29236692, RHEB binds to mTOR and causes a global conformational change that allosterically realigns active-site residues to accelerate catalysis, rather than just generically activating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Additional downstream targets**: While the model includes key downstream targets like 4E-BP1 and S6K1/2, there are other known mTORC1 substrates that could be included for a more comprehensive representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Represent mTORC1 as a complex**: Consider explicitly including RAPTOR and mLST8 as components of the mTORC1 complex, following the guidelines in the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add RAPTOR and its substrate recognition function**: Include RAPTOR and its role in binding to the TOS motif of mTORC1 substrates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include additional regulatory components**: Consider adding PRAS40 as an inhibitor of mTORC1, especially if representing responses to growth factors in addition to nutrients.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add more mechanistic details**: Enhance the description of how RHEB activates mTORC1 by including the conformational change it induces in mTOR.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Expand downstream effectors**: Consider including additional downstream targets of mTORC1 to provide a more comprehensive view of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "GO-CAM model gomodel:646ff70100004606 provides a solid representation of the inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by TSC2 in response to starvation in humans. The model accurately captures the core components and causal relationships in this pathway. With some enhancements to include complex representation, additional components, and more mechanistic details, this model could provide an even more comprehensive representation of mTORC1 regulation and function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively shows how nutrient availability (or lack thereof) signals through TSC2 to regulate RHEB activity, which in turn controls mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of key translation regulators like 4E-BP1 and S6K1/2, ultimately affecting protein synthesis rates in the cell. This regulatory circuit is critical for cellular adaptation to nutrient availability and is frequently dysregulated in cancer and other diseases.\n",

      "- **Status:** Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This model describes a molecular pathway where NLRP4 (Q96MN2) acts as a molecular adaptor to recruit USP38 (Q8NB14), which mediates deubiquitination of TBK1 (Q9UHD2), leading to a ubiquitination transition from K33-linked to K48-linked ubiquitin chains by DTX4 (Q9Y2E6), ultimately resulting in TBK1 degradation. This serves as a negative regulatory mechanism for type I interferon signaling.\n",

      "## Issues to Address\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Redundant Causal Associations\n",
      "\n",
      "In the model, USP38's deubiquitinase activity (gomodel:646ff70100004973/646ff70100004985) has duplicate causal associations to the same downstream activity:\n",
      "```\n",
      "\"causal_associations\":[{\"type\":\"CausalAssociation\",\"evidence\":[{\"term\":\"ECO:0000314\",\"reference\":\"PMID:27692986\",\"provenances\":[{\"contributor\":\"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7646-0052\",\"date\":\"2023-06-08\"}]}],\"predicate\":\"RO:0002413\",\"downstream_activity\":\"gomodel:646ff70100004973/646ff70100004995\"},\n",

      "```\n",
      "This is unnecessary duplication and should be corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. NLRP4 Inconsistency\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two NLRP4 instances (646ff70100004974 and 646ff70100004995) both annotated with the same molecular function (GO:0060090 \"molecular adaptor activity\"). It appears to be representing the same protein at different stages of the pathway, which may be unnecessarily complex. According to best practices for GO-CAM modeling, a single instance of NLRP4 should typically be used unless there's a change in state or function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Causal Relation Predicates\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model uses RO:0002413 \"provides input for\" appropriately for most connections, the model would benefit from using more specific causal relations where possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The relation between NLRP4 (646ff70100004995) and DTX4 (646ff70100005008) uses RO:0002409, but based on the described mechanism, a positive regulation predicate like RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\" might be more appropriate since NLRP4 is recruiting/enabling DTX4's ubiquitin ligase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Missing Connection to Final Outcome\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows TBK1 kinase activity (646ff70100005018) but doesn't explicitly connect this to the regulation of innate immune response or interferon signaling. Adding this context would improve the biological completeness of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Missing Process-Level Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model should include protein K48-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070936) as part of DTX4's activity, which it does, but might benefit from an additional connection to proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161) to show the ultimate fate of TBK1.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove duplicate causal associations** from USP38's activity to simplify the model and avoid redundancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consolidate the two NLRP4 instances** into a single node if they represent the same functional state, or explicitly clarify the state difference if they are intentionally modeled as distinct activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add biological consequence**: Connect TBK1 kinase activity to its role in the type I interferon signaling pathway (GO:0060337) to provide broader biological context.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add proteasomal degradation outcome**: Include a connection to GO:0043161 (proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process) to complete the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Refine causal relations**: Consider using more specific predicates like \"directly positively regulates\" or \"directly negatively regulates\" where appropriate to make the regulatory relationships clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Add K33-linked to K48-linked transition**: Make the transition from K33-linked to K48-linked ubiquitination more explicit in the model, as this is the central mechanism being described and is included in the title.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model effectively captures a key regulatory mechanism for TBK1 degradation mediated by NLRP4, USP38, and DTX4. The model follows most GO-CAM best practices but would benefit from addressing the redundancies, refining the causal relations, and providing more explicit biological context about the downstream effects on interferon signaling. With these refinements, the model would more comprehensively represent the molecular pathway described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model's core biological content is accurate and aligns with the published mechanism in PMID:27692986, where NLRP4 acts as a molecular adaptor to recruit USP38, which mediates the transition from K33 to K48 ubiquitination on TBK1, leading to its degradation and thus inhibiting type I interferon signaling.\n",

The paper suggests this mechanism is independent of TBK1 stabilization (unlike what was previously reported for USP1). This detail could make the model more informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Refine causal relationship between USP1 and STAT1**: The current relationship uses `RO:0002407` (contributes to), but the research suggests this might more specifically be a positive regulatory relationship (`RO:0002629` - directly positively regulates), as USP1 activity directly sustains STAT1 phosphorylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include STAT1 phosphorylation state**: The model could potentially note that the specific active form of STAT1 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 701 (pSTAT1), which is a key aspect of the research findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider adding viral context**: While this is implied in the title, the model could more explicitly represent that this is occurring in the context of HCMV latent infection.\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:646ff70100005032) provides an accurate and well-structured representation of how HCMV UL138 protein interacts with host deubiquitination machinery to sustain STAT1 activation during viral latency. It is consistent with the research findings and follows GO-CAM best practices for modeling protein interactions and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively captures a complex host-virus interaction that contributes to viral latency, representing an elegant mechanism by which HCMV commandeers host cell processes for its long-term persistence. With the minor suggested improvements, this would be an even more valuable contribution to our understanding of HCMV latency mechanisms in GO-CAM format.\n",

      "## GO-CAM Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "**Model ID**: [gomodel:646ff70100005137](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:646ff70100005137)  \n",
      "**Title**: IL33-signaling pathway (Human)  \n",
      "**Taxon**: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)  \n",
      "**Status**: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## General Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the IL33-signaling pathway in humans, depicting how IL-33 activates the IL-33 receptor complex (consisting of IL1RL1 and IL1RAP) and the downstream signaling cascade. The model follows a well-structured approach to explain the signal transduction from IL-33 cytokine binding to the activation of downstream effectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model correctly captures the IL-33 signaling pathway showing the proper sequence of activation events from cytokine to receptor to downstream signaling components.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The model appropriately uses the \"directly positively regulates\" predicate (RO:0002629) for causal connections between activities, which is consistent with GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Each activity has been properly contextualized with appropriate cellular locations (CC), biological processes (BP), and molecular functions (MF).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. All elements are backed by appropriate evidence codes and literature references, primarily from published papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Points for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Adaptor protein annotation**: MYD88 is annotated with \"molecular adaptor activity\" (GO:0060090) which is correct, but according to the document \"How to annotate molecular adaptors\", MYD88 should have both IL1RL1 and IRAK4 as inputs. Currently, only one causal connection is modeled showing MYD88 directly positively regulating IRAK4 kinase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Receptor-coreceptor annotation**: While the model correctly shows IL1RAP as a coreceptor with \"coreceptor activity\" (GO:0015026), the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\" suggest that there should be a causal relationship between the receptor (IL1RL1) and coreceptor (IL1RAP). Currently, there are two separate causal connections from IL1RAP to MYD88.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Redundant causal links**: IL1RAP appears to have two identical causal connections to MYD88 (both are RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\"). One of these is likely redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pathway completion**: The model captures the pathway from IL33 through MAP3K7 (TAK1) but doesn't show the final downstream effects (e.g., activation of transcription factors or gene expression). While this is not necessarily incorrect, extending the model to show these endpoints would provide a more complete representation.\n",

      "## Literature Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well supported by appropriate literature references. Key references like PMID:27830702 and PMID:16286016 appropriately describe the IL-33 signaling pathway and the role of IL1RL1 (ST2) as the primary receptor for IL-33.\n",
      "\n",
      "The referenced paper (PMID:27830702) confirms IL-33's role in activating ST2 (IL1RL1) and IL1RAP to mediate downstream signaling. The paper also supports the involvement of MYD88, IRAK4, and TRAF6 in this pathway, consistent with the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add missing inputs for MYD88**: According to the molecular adaptor guidelines, MYD88 should have both IL1RL1 and IRAK4 as inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Resolve redundant causal links**: Remove one of the duplicate causal associations from IL1RAP to MYD88.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add a direct causal link between IL1RL1 and IL1RAP**: According to the signaling receptor activity guidelines, there should be a causal relationship between the receptor (IL1RL1) and coreceptor (IL1RAP).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Extend the pathway downstream**: Consider extending the model to include the downstream effects of MAP3K7 activation, such as the activation of NF-κB and/or MAP kinases, and the resulting gene expression changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add additional supporting evidence**: While the current evidence is solid, adding more recent papers could strengthen the model further, especially for the downstream components.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the IL-33 signaling pathway in humans. It follows most of the GO-CAM best practices and is supported by appropriate literature references. With the suggested improvements, particularly regarding the adaptor protein annotation and the receptor-coreceptor relationship, the model would more accurately represent the biology of IL-33 signaling according to current knowledge and GO-CAM guidelines.\n",

      "## Summary\n",
      "This model represents the \"Regulation of the canonical mTORC1 signaling via ubiquitination and deubiquitination of RHEB by RNF152 and USP4, respectively (Human)\" pathway. It effectively captures a recently discovered regulatory mechanism involving post-translational modification of RHEB that governs mTORC1 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the key components and relationships in the RHEB-dependent regulation of mTORC1 signaling pathway based on current literature (notably PMID:30514904 and PMID:24529379). The causal relationships and molecular functions are appropriately modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate representation of molecular functions**: The model correctly assigns molecular functions to proteins - RNF152 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, USP4 as a deubiquitinase, and the roles of mTOR, RHEB, and TSC2 in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal associations**: The model correctly uses appropriate causal relationship predicates (RO:0002629 for direct positive regulation and RO:0002630 for direct negative regulation) between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subcellular localization**: Many activities correctly specify cellular localization, particularly at the lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765), which is critical for this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence support**: Each activity and association is backed by appropriate PMIDs and evidence codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complete pathway representation**: The model comprehensively captures the entire signaling cascade from the initial ubiquitination/deubiquitination events through mTORC1 activation to downstream effects on translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Improvement Opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input relationship for RNF152**: In the model, there's no explicit \"has input\" relationship showing that RNF152 (E3 ubiquitin ligase activity) has RHEB as its substrate. According to the E3 ubiquitin ligase documentation, the model should indicate that RNF152's ubiquitin ligase activity \"has input\" RHEB.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological process for USP4**: The USP4 deubiquitinase activity (GO:0004843) is appropriately annotated as part of \"positive regulation of TORC1 signaling\" (GO:1904263), but it could be additionally marked as part of \"protein deubiquitination\" or specifically \"protein monoubiquitination\" to be more precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ubiquitin type specification**: The model doesn't specify that RHEB undergoes monoubiquitination (rather than polyubiquitination), as detailed in the literature. This could be specified in biological process annotations for relevant activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **AKT1 phosphorylation of USP4**: While the model includes AKT1's protein kinase activity that positively regulates USP4's deubiquitinase activity, it would be helpful to explicitly indicate through annotations that AKT1 phosphorylates USP4 at Ser445.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Integration with amino acid sensing pathway**: The model focuses on growth factor-induced mTORC1 activation via RHEB regulation but doesn't incorporate the amino acid sensing pathway involving Rag GTPases, which functions in parallel. This is not necessarily a problem but represents an opportunity for future model expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "From a technical perspective, the model correctly follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The activities are connected appropriately with causal relationships.\n",
      "2. Gene products are correctly associated with their functions.\n",
      "3. Molecular functions are indicated as \"enabled by\" the appropriate gene products.\n",
      "4. Cellular locations are specified where known.\n",
      "5. Evidence codes and references are properly provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures the biological knowledge from the published literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **RHEB regulation mechanism**: The model correctly shows that RHEB is monoubiquitinated by RNF152 (notably at Lys8), which promotes its binding to the TSC complex and prevents its activation of mTORC1. Conversely, USP4 removes this ubiquitin, allowing RHEB to activate mTORC1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Growth factor signaling**: The model correctly represents that EGF/growth factor signaling leads to AKT1 activation, which phosphorylates USP4, enhancing its ability to deubiquitinate RHEB.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **mTORC1 downstream signaling**: The model correctly depicts the downstream effects of mTORC1 activation on S6K1/2 and 4E-BP1, leading to enhanced translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Subcellular localization**: The model correctly places these interactions at the lysosomal membrane, which is a key aspect of mTORC1 regulation as shown in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add explicit \"has input\" relationships for both the E3 ubiquitin ligase (RNF152) and deubiquitinase (USP4) activities to specify RHEB as their substrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider adding \"protein monoubiquitination\" (GO:0006513) as a biological process for RNF152's activity to be more specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. For a more complete picture, consider expanding the model in the future to include the interaction with the amino acid sensing pathway involving Rag GTPases and the Ragulator complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider adding more detailed annotations about the phosphorylation site of USP4 (Ser445) to provide additional mechanistic detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The model appears to be ready for promotion to production status, as it accurately represents current understanding of this pathway with strong evidence support.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model effectively represents the current understanding of RHEB regulation via ubiquitination/deubiquitination and its impact on mTORC1 signaling. The model is technically sound and scientifically accurate. With minor enhancements as suggested, it would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important signaling pathway.

      "This GO-CAM represents the regulation of mTORC1 signaling via a novel mechanism involving the deubiquitinase ATXN3 (Ataxin-3) and polyubiquitination of RHEB in response to amino acid availability. The model captures how amino acids enhance the polyubiquitination of RHEB, which increases its binding affinity for mTORC1, thereby promoting mTORC1 activation. Conversely, during amino acid starvation, ATXN3 is recruited to the lysosomal membrane where it deubiquitinates RHEB, leading to decreased mTORC1 binding and inhibition of mTORC1 signaling.\n",

      "2. **Proper cellular component annotation**: Each activity is correctly annotated with its subcellular location (e.g., lysosomal membrane for ATXN3, RHEB, and TSC2).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate part_of relations**: Activities are correctly associated with the biological processes they participate in.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence codes and references**: Each assertion is supported by appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) and PMID references.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Molecular function selection**: The molecular functions assigned to each protein (deubiquitinase for ATXN3, GTPase activator for TSC2, etc.) are accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the findings of Yao et al. (PMID:33157014), which demonstrated that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Amino acids enhance polyubiquitination of RHEB, which increases its binding to mTORC1\n",
      "2. ATXN3 is a deubiquitinase that targets RHEB\n",
      "3. Under amino acid starvation, inactive Rag GTPases recruit ATXN3 to lysosomes\n",
      "4. ATXN3 deubiquitinates RHEB, promoting TSC2 GAP activity toward RHEB\n",
      "5. Decreased RHEB activity leads to inhibition of mTORC1 signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is primarily supported by experimental evidence from the following PMIDs:\n",
      "- PMID:33157014 (Yao et al., 2020) - Primary source establishing ATXN3's role\n",
      "- PMID:9045618, PMID:12906785, PMID:24529379 - Supporting TSC2's role\n",
      "- PMID:29236692, PMID:15854902 - Supporting RHEB's role in mTORC1 activation\n",

      "\n",
      "All evidence codes are correctly applied as ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Parsimony and Clarity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is parsimonious and clearly represents the regulatory pathway. It focuses on the core regulatory mechanism (ATXN3 → RHEB → mTORC1) without unnecessary details, while including sufficient context (mTORC1 downstream effectors) to convey the biological significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Improvements Suggested\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clarify the conditions**: While the title indicates \"in response to starvation,\" the model could more explicitly annotate the different states (amino acid replete vs. starved).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider including ubiquitinated RHEB as a distinct node**: Since the ubiquitination status of RHEB is central to the mechanism, representing ubiquitinated RHEB as a distinct entity might enhance clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incorporate the Rag GTPases**: The model does not explicitly include the role of Rag GTPases in recruiting ATXN3 to lysosomes during amino acid starvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model effectively captures a novel mechanism of mTORC1 regulation via ATXN3-mediated deubiquitination of RHEB in response to amino acid availability. The model is well-supported by literature evidence, adheres to GO-CAM best practices, and clearly represents the biological process. The molecular functions, cellular components, and causal relations are all appropriately represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of nutrient-sensing pathways and represents a high-quality GO-CAM that could serve as an exemplar for similar regulatory models.\n",

      "1. **Expand the KICSTOR complex representation**: Add specific members of the complex as per GO-CAM guidelines for complex representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include additional downstream effects**: Consider expanding the model to include more downstream effects of mTORC1 activation on translation, metabolism, and autophagy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Refine molecular adaptor annotations**: Ensure that protein-membrane adaptor activities follow the guidelines for molecular adaptor annotation with appropriate \"has input\" relations.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model titled \"Activation of the canonical mTORC1 signaling by BMT2/SAMTOR in response to S-adenosyl-L-methionine influx (Human)\" represents a detailed pathway describing how mTORC1 signaling is regulated in response to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) availability in human cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Accuracy and Literature Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by multiple peer-reviewed publications, with each activity and relationship properly referenced using ECO evidence codes and relevant PMIDs. Key papers including PMID:28199306, PMID:31601708, and PMID:31601764 provide strong experimental evidence for the relationships depicted in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of how mTORC1 signaling is activated in response to S-adenosyl-L-methionine, with BMT2/SAMTOR acting as a sensor for this metabolite. The lysosomal localization of the pathway components and the role of the KICSTOR complex are consistent with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pathway Logic and Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow of the pathway is logically presented:\n",
      "1. BMT2 (Q1RMZ1) binds S-adenosyl-L-methionine\n",
      "2. This regulates activity of the KICSTOR complex, which acts as a protein-membrane adaptor\n",
      "3. KICSTOR regulates NPRL2 (GTPase activator activity) and DEPDC5 (small GTPase binding)\n",
      "4. These proteins negatively regulate the activities of RagA/RRAGA and RagC/RRAGC GTPases\n",
      "5. The Rag GTPases regulate RHEB activity\n",
      "6. RHEB activates the mTOR kinase activity\n",
      "7. mTOR phosphorylates downstream targets including RPS6KB1/2 and EIF4EBP1\n",
      "8. These ultimately affect translation through RPS6\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compartmentalization\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the lysosomal localization (GO:0005765) of many of the components, which is critical for mTORC1 signaling and is well-documented in the literature. This is supported by experimental evidence from PMID:28199306 and PMID:30956113.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Function Term Usage\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate molecular function terms, including:\n",
      "- GO:1904047 (S-adenosyl-L-methionine binding) for BMT2\n",
      "- GO:0043495 (protein-membrane adaptor activity) for KICSTOR components\n",

      "\n",
      "These accurately represent the established molecular functions of these proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Use of Causal Relations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly uses the causal relations:\n",
      "- RO:0012010 (provides input for) where appropriate\n",
      "- RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for positive regulation\n",
      "- RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for negative regulation\n",

      "These follow GO-CAM guidelines for representing regulatory relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adaptor Protein Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows best practices for representing adaptor proteins as described in the \"How to annotate molecular adaptors\" document. The KICSTOR complex (represented by activity gomodel:6482692800000701/6482692800000845) is annotated with protein-membrane adaptor activity (GO:0043495) and properly connects to downstream elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Issues and Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: The model indicates that the KICSTOR complex (GO:0140007) enables one of the activities, but doesn't specify the members of the complex in the \"enabled_by\" field. It would be helpful to include the component proteins for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological Process Coverage**: While most activities are linked to appropriate biological processes, it might be helpful to also include the higher-level process GO:0031669 (cellular response to nutrient levels) for some components to better link this pathway to the broader nutrient sensing role.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a high-quality GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of mTORC1 signaling regulation by S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Is well-supported by literature evidence with appropriate references\n",
      "2. Uses the correct molecular function terms for all components\n",

      "4. Uses appropriate causal relations between activities\n",
      "5. Follows GO-CAM best practices for representing adaptor functions\n",

      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate Representation of Signaling Pathway:** The model correctly represents the mTORC1 signaling pathway activated by amino acid abundance, following established knowledge of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence Quality:** Each activity and relationship is supported by primary literature evidence with appropriate ECO codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Context:** The model properly includes cellular contexts (predominantly GO:0005765 \"lysosomal membrane\"), which is consistent with where mTORC1 signaling occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological Process Context:** Each activity is correctly associated with relevant biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Causal Relationships:** The model uses appropriate causal relationships (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\" and RO:0002630 \"directly negatively regulates\") to show the flow of regulation in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Improvement Opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation:** The model represents individual proteins rather than showing the GATOR1 and GATOR2 complexes as entities. This is acceptable according to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines when the subunits carrying specific activities are known. However, for clarity, considering that GATOR1 and GATOR2 are well-defined complexes, it might be beneficial to include a note about which proteins belong to which complex. The model includes NPRL2 (part of GATOR1) and WDR24 (part of GATOR2), but this relationship is not explicitly stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Inputs:** Some molecular functions are missing the \"has input\" relationship that would clarify their targets. For example, the protein kinase activities should explicitly show what they phosphorylate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Model Clarity:** The model represents multiple proteins with similar functions (e.g., both RRAGC and RRAGA have GTP binding activity and protein-membrane adaptor activity). While biologically accurate, the parallel activities may make the model more complex to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing Cellular Components:** Some activities don't have \"occurs in\" annotations to specify their cellular location, which would help contextualize the activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Verification of Specific Model Elements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GTPase Activities:** The model correctly represents the GTP/GDP-bound states of the Rag proteins and their regulation by GATOR1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **mTOR Kinase Activity:** The model accurately shows mTOR (P42345) phosphorylating S6K proteins (RPS6KB1/RPS6KB2), which in turn phosphorylate the ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Translation Regulation:** The model correctly shows 4E-BP1 (EIF4EBP1) as a translation repressor that is inhibited by mTOR, leading to increased translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy Check\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at some key elements in the model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Amino Acid Sensing:** The model represents how amino acid abundance leads to inhibition of GATOR1, which is scientifically accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Rag GTPases:** The model correctly shows that Rag GTPases (RRAGA and RRAGC) are regulated by GATOR1 and help localize mTORC1 to lysosomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **RHEB Activation:** The model properly shows RHEB activating mTOR kinase, which is a key step in mTORC1 signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Downstream Effectors:** The phosphorylation cascade from mTOR to S6K to S6, and the inhibition of 4E-BP1, are all correctly represented and consistent with established knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:6482692800001029](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6482692800001029)) provides a high-quality representation of mTORC1 signaling activated by amino acid abundance. It meets GO-CAM best practices in terms of evidence, causal relationships, and biological accuracy.

      "4. **Cellular context inclusion**: Appropriate cellular locations are specified for activities (e.g., plasma membrane for transporters).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing bioprocess annotations**: While Acaca has an activity annotation, it lacks a specific biological process annotation. Given its role, it could be annotated as part of \"fatty acid biosynthetic process\" ([GO:0006633](https://bioregistry.io/GO:0006633)).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Recent evidence update**: The model has a comment \"Automated change 2024-06-27: GO:0018271 replaced by GO:0004077\" - this update was correctly implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing cellular component for Hlcs**: The UniProt entry for Hlcs indicates it's located in both the cytoplasm and mitochondrion, but no cellular component is specified in the model. Adding this would improve the spatial representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Expansion opportunity**: The literature suggests Hlcs may also biotinylate histones, which could be included in an expanded version of this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Potential missing regulation**: The literature suggests biotin levels adaptively regulate intestinal uptake of biotin, which could be represented as an additional regulatory relationship in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current scientific understanding of biotin metabolism:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Biotin is transported into the cell by the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (Slc5a6)\n",
      "2. Hlcs catalyzes the biotinylation of carboxylases\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Biotin Metabolic Process 1 (Mouse)\" is a well-constructed representation of biotin metabolism that adheres to most GO-CAM best practices.

      "\n",
      "# GO-CAM Review: Inactivation of mTORC1 signaling via WDR24 phosphorylation by AMPK\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (available at https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6482692800001514) represents the regulatory pathway by which AMPK phosphorylates WDR24, a component of the GATOR2 complex, leading to inactivation of mTORC1 signaling in response to glucose starvation. The model effectively captures a key regulatory mechanism for mTOR signaling that adapts to cellular energy status.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model accurately represents the current scientific understanding of how AMPK phosphorylates WDR24 to suppress glucose-mediated mTORC1 activation, as described in the primary literature (PMID:36732624).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model effectively captures both the upstream regulatory events (AMPK activation and WDR24 phosphorylation) and downstream consequences (repression of translation via 4E-BP1 and regulation of S6 phosphorylation).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct use of causal associations**: The model uses appropriate causal predicates to link activities, including:\n",
      "   - RO:0002413 (provides input for) for AMPK's influence on YWHAG sequestering activity\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for activating relationships\n",
      "   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for inhibitory relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Subcellular localization**: The model appropriately represents the lysosomal localization of key components, which is critical for mTORC1 signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Representation of protein complexes**: The model represents individual proteins rather than the GATOR2 complex itself for certain activities. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, when the specific subunit carrying the molecular activity is known (as is the case with WDR24's ubiquitin ligase activity), this approach is appropriate. However, if there are activities where the exact subunit is unknown, using the GO complex ID might be more appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional contextual information**: Though the model represents glucose starvation context, it could benefit from inclusion of amino acid regulation, as GATOR2 also responds to amino acid levels, which would provide a more complete picture of the regulatory mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Documentation of AMPK isoforms**: The model includes both PRKAA1 (AMPKα1) and PRKAA2 (AMPKα2) with identical causal relationships. While this is accurate, a note explaining their redundant but important complementary roles would be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence codes and references**: All activities and associations are properly supported with ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) and appropriate PMID references.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular functions**: The model uses appropriate molecular functions for each protein:\n",
      "   - GO:0004679 (AMP-activated protein kinase activity) for AMPK subunits\n",
      "   - GO:0140311 (protein sequestering activity) for YWHAG\n",
      "   - GO:0061630 (ubiquitin protein ligase activity) for WDR24\n",
      "   - GO:0005096 (GTPase activator activity) for NPRL2\n",
      "   - GO:0004674 (protein serine/threonine kinase activity) for mTOR\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological process context**: Each activity is appropriately placed in relevant biological processes:\n",
      "   - GO:1904262 (negative regulation of TORC1 signaling)\n",
      "   - GO:0085020 (protein K6-linked ubiquitination)\n",
      "   - GO:0045948 (positive regulation of translational initiation)\n",
      "   - GO:0045947 (negative regulation of translational initiation)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Occurs_in annotations**: Proper lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765) localization is specified for key components of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the pathway described in the literature (particularly PMID:36732624), where:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Glucose deprivation activates AMPK (PRKAA1/PRKAA2)\n",
      "2. AMPK phosphorylates WDR24 (a GATOR2 component) at Ser155\n",
      "3. Phosphorylated WDR24 is recognized by 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAG)\n",
      "4. This sequestration disrupts GATOR2 complex integrity\n",
      "5. Disrupted GATOR2 cannot inhibit NPRL2 (part of GATOR1)\n",
      "6. Active NPRL2 inhibits RRAGA/RRAGC GTPases\n",
      "7. This prevents mTORC1 activation\n",
      "8. Resulting in altered regulation of translation via 4E-BP1 and S6\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex annotation**: Consider using GO complex terms when appropriate, particularly if additional GATOR2 activities are added where the specific active subunit is unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional pathway contexts**: Consider expanding the model to include how this pathway interacts with amino acid sensing pathways, as GATOR2 also responds to amino acid levels via Sestrin and CASTOR proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback regulation**: Consider including feedback mechanisms by which mTOR signaling can regulate upstream components, if supported by literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model successfully represents a well-documented mechanism for AMPK-mediated regulation of mTORC1 via WDR24 phosphorylation. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices regarding causal representations and evidential support. It captures the key biological aspects of this regulatory pathway and presents them in a clear, logical flow that is consistent with current literature.\n",

The model effectively captures a critical cellular energy-sensing pathway that regulates cell growth and metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-constructed and accurately represents the current understanding of AMPK-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. The biological content is supported by the literature and uses appropriate Gene Ontology (GO) terms for molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes.\n",

      "The model appropriately places activities in their cellular locations, with MTOR and RPTOR being localized to the lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765), which is where mTORC1 signaling occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pathway Representation:\n",
      "The model effectively captures the following causal relationships:\n",
      "1. AMPK phosphorylates Raptor (RO:0002413 \"provides input for\") and negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling\n",
      "2. YWHAZ sequesters phosphorylated Raptor (RO:0002630 \"directly negatively regulates\") \n",
      "3. RHEB activates MTOR (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\")\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Connections:\n",
      "The model provides appropriate evidence from scientific literature:\n",
      "- PMID:18439900 - Primary evidence for AMPK phosphorylation of Raptor\n",
      "- PMID:37541260 - Recent evidence supporting the O-GlcNAcylation of Raptor in glucose signaling\n",

      "## Alignment with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon review of the GO-CAM documentation and best practices, I find that this model follows the rules for complex representation. Since the activity of each component in the pathway is known and defined, each protein is represented individually with its specific molecular function, rather than using a complex GO term. This follows the guidelines in the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological content of the model is consistent with current scientific understanding:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents AMPK as a metabolic sensor that responds to energy depletion (specifically glucose starvation) by phosphorylating RPTOR at Ser722 and Ser792.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The model correctly shows that phosphorylation of RPTOR leads to inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, as supported by the literature (PMID:18439900).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The inclusion of O-GlcNAcylation by OGT (supported by PMID:37541260) reflects recent findings that glucose availability controls mTORC1 activity through post-translational modification of RPTOR.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The inclusion of YWHAZ (14-3-3 protein) as a mediator that sequesters phosphorylated RPTOR is accurate and well-supported by the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The placement of these events within the context of biological processes (GO:1904262 \"negative regulation of TORC1 signaling\" and GO:0038202 \"TORC1 signaling\") is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Potential Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I suggest a few potential enhancements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Subcellular location refinement**: While MTOR is correctly placed at the lysosomal membrane, AMPK's subcellular location is not specified. Given that AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of RPTOR can occur in the cytoplasm, this could be explicitly noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Upstream regulation**: The model focuses on AMPK's action on RPTOR but does not include how AMPK itself is activated by glucose starvation (e.g., through increased AMP:ATP ratio and activation by upstream kinases like LKB1). Including this would provide more context.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream effects**: While the model shows inhibition of mTORC1, it could be extended to show some key downstream effects, such as inhibition of S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, which affect protein synthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Temporal sequence**: The model could more explicitly show the temporal sequence of events from glucose starvation to AMPK activation to RPTOR phosphorylation to mTORC1 inhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([go.model:6482692800002523](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6482692800002523)) describes the molybdopterin cofactor biosynthetic process in mouse. The model includes 6 different gene products (Nfs1, Mocs3, Mocs2, Gphn, Mocs1, and Mocos) that form a pathway in the cytosol, with each protein performing specific molecular functions that contribute to the overall biosynthetic process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents a linear pathway of the following activities:\n",
      "1. Mocs1 (MGI:MGI:1928904) - S-adenosyl-L-methionine binding (GO:1904047)\n",
      "2. Mocs2 (MGI:MGI:1336894) - molybdopterin synthase activity (GO:0030366)\n",
      "3. Gphn (MGI:MGI:109602) - molybdopterin molybdotransferase activity (GO:0061599)\n",
      "4. Mocos (MGI:MGI:1915841) - molybdenum cofactor sulfurtransferase activity (GO:0008265)\n",
      "\n",
      "With two additional activities connected to the pathway:\n",
      "- Nfs1 (MGI:MGI:1316706) - cysteine desulfurase activity (GO:0031071)\n",
      "- Mocs3 (MGI:MGI:1916622) - sulfurtransferase activity (GO:0016783)\n",
      "\n",
      "These are linked through causal relations that properly represent the flow of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "- The model correctly captures the key activities in the molybdopterin cofactor biosynthetic pathway\n",
      "- All activities have appropriate evidence with relevant references (PMIDs)\n",
      "- The causal flow is biologically meaningful and follows the known sequence of the pathway\n",
      "- All activities are correctly placed in the cytosol (GO:0005829) cellular component\n",
      "- Appropriate predicate types are used for the causal links between activities\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Evidence for Subcellular Location\n",
      "The activity for Mocos (MGI:MGI:1915841) lacks evidence for its subcellular location in GO:0005829 (cytosol). While this is the correct location based on literature, the annotation should include supporting evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Coherence with Literature\n",
      "The model aligns well with the referenced literature, particularly PMID:23593335, which describes how the L-cysteine desulfurase NFS1 provides sulfur for molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. The causal link from Nfs1 to Mocs3 accurately reflects this relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Causal Relations\n",
      "The model would benefit from having explicit evidence for the causal relations between activities. Currently, none of the causal associations include explicit evidence annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Completeness of Representation\n",
      "The model represents the pathway correctly but could be enhanced by including:\n",
      "- Information about the complex formation between certain participants if relevant\n",
      "- More detailed representation of the thiol transfer mechanism\n",
      "- Any relevant regulatory steps that might not be captured in the current model\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Compliance\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "- Using appropriate molecular functions for each gene product\n",
      "- Placing activities in correct cellular components\n",
      "- Using appropriate part_of relations to connect to the biological process\n",
      "- Using appropriate causal relationships between activities\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a clear representation of the molybdopterin cofactor biosynthetic process in mouse. It successfully captures the key molecular activities and their causal relationships. The model would be improved by adding evidence for the missing subcellular location and for the causal relationships between activities. Overall, this is a well-constructed model that follows GO-CAM best practices and accurately represents the biology of molybdopterin cofactor biosynthesis based on current literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Revisions\n",
      "1. Add evidence for the subcellular location (GO:0005829) of Mocos (MGI:MGI:1915841)\n",

      "# GO-CAM Review: gomodel:6482692800002614\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This model represents the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling pathway that leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of the transcription factors TFEB and TFE3 in humans. The model depicts how these transcription factors are regulated by nutrient availability through a protein degradation pathway involving Rag GTPases, mTORC1, and E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "The model captures key activities including:\n",
      "1. Protein kinase activity of mTOR (P42345)\n",
      "2. Protein sequestering activity of 14-3-3/YWHAZ (P63104)\n",
      "3. DNA-binding transcription factor activities of TFEB (P19484) and TFE3 (P19532)\n",
      "4. Enzyme-substrate adaptor activity of RRAGC (Q9HB90)\n",
      "5. GTPase activator activity of FLCN (Q8NFG4)\n",
      "6. Ubiquitin-related activities of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CUL1, BTRC, RBX1)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the current understanding of the nutrient-dependent regulation of TFE3 and TFEB, based on the primary literature (especially PMID:36608670).\n",
      "2. The model correctly captures the causal relationships between activities, particularly the regulatory mechanisms that control transcription factor localization and stability.\n",
      "3. Appropriate cellular locations are annotated for each activity (lysosomal membrane, cytosol, nucleus).\n",
      "4. The biological processes for each activity are appropriately annotated.\n",
      "5. The causal relationships use appropriate relation types (RO:0002413, RO:0002629, RO:0002630).\n",
      "6. The model covers both the phosphorylation-dependent cytosolic retention pathway and the newly discovered ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Potential Issues and Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Missing protein activity representation\n",
      "According to the paper by Nardone et al. (PMID:36608670), phosphorylation of TFE3 at Ser-47 by mTOR creates a phospho-degron that is recognized by β-TrCP (BTRC). While the model correctly captures the causal relationship between mTOR kinase activity and BTRC ubiquitin ligase adaptor activity, it would be clearer if the model explicitly showed that mTOR provides input for BTRC through phosphorylation of TFE3/TFEB.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Representation of the protein degradation mechanism\n",
      "The model shows that BTRC provides input for RBX1's ubiquitin protein ligase activity, which in turn negatively regulates TFE3's transcription factor activity. However, the model could more clearly represent that this is through protein degradation via the proteasome pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Consistency in GO terms\n",
      "The model uses GO:0007040 (lysosome organization) as the biological process for both TFE3 and TFEB transcription factor activities. While this is appropriate, it would be beneficial to also include GO:1904263 (positive regulation of TORC1 signaling) as a biological process for FLCN and RRAGC activities to maintain consistency throughout the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Representation of complex formation\n",
      "According to the GO-CAM guidelines for annotating complexes, since the SCF complex components (CUL1, BTRC, RBX1) have defined and precise activities, they are correctly displayed individually in the model. However, it might be helpful to clarify that they function as part of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in the model annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Evidence code and references\n",
      "All activities in the model are supported by appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) and PMID references. However, a few of the causal associations have evidence from a single publication, and it might be beneficial to include additional supporting literature where available.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the key findings from recent research, particularly the paper by Nardone et al. (PMID:36608670) which describes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The discovery of a degradation pathway for TFE3 and MITF-A (but not TFEB) involving CUL1-β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase.\n",
      "2. The phosphorylation of a conserved degron in TFE3 and MITF-A by mTORC1, which is recruited to the lysosomal surface by active Rag GTPases.\n",
      "3. The role of protein stability in controlling the transcriptional activity of these factors, in addition to the previously known mechanism of cytosolic retention by 14-3-3 proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly shows that:\n",
      "- RRAGC has enzyme-substrate adaptor activity that negatively regulates FLCN and mTOR activities\n",
      "- mTOR phosphorylates TFE3, creating a degron recognized by the SCF complex\n",
      "- The SCF complex components (CUL1, BTRC, RBX1) cooperate to ubiquitinate TFE3, leading to its degradation\n",
      "- YWHAZ (14-3-3) sequesters TFE3 in the cytoplasm, preventing its transcription factor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality GO-CAM model that effectively represents current knowledge about the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling pathway leading to TFEB and TFE3 inactivation. The model incorporates recent discoveries about protein degradation mechanisms in addition to the previously known cytosolic retention pathway. \n",
      "\n",
      "The model meets GO-CAM best practices and accurately represents the biological pathway. With minor enhancements suggested above, it could serve as an excellent reference model for understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling these important transcription factors.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pathway Description\n",
      "The model depicts a signaling pathway where:\n",
      "1. SUCNR1 functions as a G-protein coupled receptor (GO:0004930)\n",
      "2. SUCNR1 provides input for AMP-activated protein kinase activity (PRKAA1/AMPK, GO:0004679)\n",
      "3. AMPK activates JNK kinase activity (MAPK8, GO:0004705)\n",
      "4. JNK activates transcription coregulator activity (BMAL1, GO:0003712)\n",
      "5. BMAL1 positively regulates DNA-binding transcription activator activity (CEBPA, GO:0001228)\n",
      "6. CEBPA provides input for hormone activity (LEP, GO:0005179)\n",
      "\n",
      "All components participate in energy homeostasis (GO:0097009), which is the overall biological process being modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model appears to be well-supported by the referenced literature. The primary reference (PMID:36977414) is a comprehensive study that elucidates the role of succinate/SUCNR1 in controlling leptin expression via the circadian clock. The pathway presented in the GO-CAM model closely aligns with the paper's findings, which show that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. SUCNR1 activation in adipocytes leads to AMPK phosphorylation/activation\n",
      "2. AMPK activates JNK\n",

      "\n",
      "### Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "Each activity in the model is supported by evidence with appropriate ECO codes and references:\n",
      "- SUCNR1 receptor activity is supported by PMID:18820681\n",
      "- AMPK activity is supported by MGI:MGI:5005039/PMID:21459323\n",

      "\n",
      "The evidence codes are appropriate for the assertions made, primarily using ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) for experimentally determined relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Complex Representation\n",
      "The model does not depict any protein complexes, which is appropriate since the activities are clearly attributed to individual proteins in the pathway. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, when the specific subunits carrying molecular activities are known (as they are in this model), the complex itself doesn't need to be explicitly described.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates:\n",
      "- RO:0002407 \"provides input for\" is used between SUCNR1 and AMPK, and between CEBPA and LEP\n",
      "- RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\" is used between BMAL1 and CEBPA\n",
      "- RO:0002407 \"provides input for\" is also used between AMPK and JNK, and between JNK and BMAL1\n",
      "\n",
      "These predicates accurately reflect the nature of the relationships between activities as described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Context\n",
      "The model includes appropriate cellular locations for each activity:\n",
      "- SUCNR1 at plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "- AMPK and JNK in cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "- BMAL1 and CEBPA in nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "- LEP in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "\n",
      "These locations are correctly assigned and align with the known biological context of these proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Process Integration\n",
      "All activities are appropriately integrated into the energy homeostasis biological process (GO:0097009), which is the main theme of the research paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is scientifically accurate and follows GO-CAM best practices, there are a few areas that could be enhanced:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Circadian Regulation Context**: While BMAL1 is included as a core circadian clock component, the model could potentially include more details about how the circadian rhythm is affected, possibly by including other clock components mentioned in the paper like PER1, PER2, and PER3, which are downregulated by succinate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Upstream Triggers**: The model doesn't explicitly include succinate as the ligand that activates SUCNR1. Including this small molecule could provide more context about how the pathway is initiated.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback Mechanisms**: The paper mentions that circadian dysfunction induces leptin resistance, which could potentially be included as a feedback mechanism if this is relevant to the pathway being modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Context Refinement**: While the model specifies that these activities occur in adipocytes (as described in the title), this could be made more explicit in the model by specifying the cell type as white adipocyte (CL:0000448), which is included in the model objects but not directly connected to the activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "GO-CAM model 648d0dc100000022 provides an accurate representation of how SUCNR1 in adipocytes controls energy homeostasis by modulating circadian clock and LEP expression, as described in the referenced literature. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities, causal relationships, and cellular context. While there are some potential areas for enhancement, these are minor considerations and do not detract from the model's overall quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully captures the key finding of the research paper: that the succinate receptor SUCNR1 controls leptin expression in adipocytes through a signaling pathway involving AMPK, JNK, BMAL1, and CEBPA, ultimately contributing to energy homeostasis regulation.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Title\n",
      "Phosphorylation of DEPTOR by MAPK3/ERK1 promotes DEPTOR deubiquitination by USP7 and enhanced protein stability (Human).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes a signaling pathway in which MAPK3/ERK1 phosphorylates DEPTOR (DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein), leading to USP7 (Ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 7) deubiquitination activity that enhances DEPTOR protein stability, ultimately resulting in negative regulation of TORC1 signaling. The model is well-structured, with appropriate causal relationships, and is consistent with recent literature on this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the following activities and relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. MAPK3/ERK1 (UniProtKB:P27361) with protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) as part of TORC1 negative regulation (GO:1904262) provides input for (RO:0002413) USP7 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. USP7 (UniProtKB:Q93009) with cysteine-type deubiquitinase activity (GO:0004843) as part of protein stabilization (GO:0050821) directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) DEPTOR activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. DEPTOR (UniProtKB:Q8TB45) with protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor activity (GO:0030291) as part of positive regulation of autophagy (GO:0010508) directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) mTOR activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. mTOR (UniProtKB:P42345) with protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) as part of mTORC1 signaling (GO:0038202) directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) ULK1 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. All appropriate cellular locations are specified, with mTOR and DEPTOR occurring in the lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by scientific evidence, primarily from the paper \"Turnover of the mTOR inhibitor, DEPTOR, and downstream AKT phosphorylation in multiple myeloma cells, is dependent on ERK1-mediated phosphorylation\" (PMID:35216969). This recent paper (2022) provides strong experimental evidence for the role of MAPK3/ERK1 phosphorylation of DEPTOR at Ser-235, which promotes USP7 deubiquitination activity and enhances DEPTOR stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional evidence for the components of this pathway comes from multiple papers cited in the model, including PMID:22017875, PMID:22017876, PMID:12087098, and PMID:29750193, which establish the roles of DEPTOR in mTOR inhibition and autophagy regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices with:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Appropriate use of molecular function terms for each gene product\n",
      "2. Correct biological process terms that match the activities\n",
      "3. Proper use of causal relationship predicates to connect the activities\n",
      "4. Accurate cellular component annotations\n",
      "5. Well-structured evidence with supporting publications\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures a signaling cascade where:\n",
      "- MAPK3/ERK1 phosphorylates DEPTOR\n",
      "- This recruits USP7 deubiquitinase to DEPTOR\n",
      "- USP7 deubiquitinates DEPTOR, promoting its stability\n",
      "- Stabilized DEPTOR inhibits mTOR activity\n",
      "- Inhibited mTOR has reduced ability to phosphorylate and inhibit ULK1\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with current understanding of DEPTOR regulation and function. The UniProt records for DEPTOR (Q8TB45) specifically mention that \"Phosphorylation at Ser-235 by MAPK3/ERK1 promotes deubiquitination by USP7, enhancing its stability.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper (PMID:35216969) provides detailed experimental evidence for this pathway in multiple myeloma cells, showing that:\n",
      "1. ERK1 phosphorylates DEPTOR at Ser-235\n",
      "2. This phosphorylation mediates USP7 binding to DEPTOR\n",
      "3. USP7 deubiquitinates DEPTOR, preventing its degradation\n",
      "4. Stabilized DEPTOR inhibits mTOR signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents this biological pathway and the key molecular mechanisms involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is scientifically accurate and well-structured, a few minor improvements could be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Details**: The specific phosphorylation site (Ser-235) on DEPTOR could be included as an annotation or comment for greater precision.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Context Specificity**: The model could note that this pathway is particularly relevant in multiple myeloma cells where DEPTOR is frequently overexpressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream Effects**: The model could be extended to include the effects on AKT phosphorylation, which is a key downstream consequence of this pathway according to the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:648d0dc100000867](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:648d0dc100000867)) accurately represents the pathway in which MAPK3/ERK1 phosphorylates DEPTOR, leading to USP7-mediated deubiquitination and enhanced DEPTOR stability, ultimately resulting in mTOR inhibition. The model is well-supported by recent literature, properly structured according to GO-CAM standards, and provides a valuable representation of this signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model makes appropriate use of causal relationships to connect molecular activities and accurately describes the biological processes involved in this pathway. Overall, this is a high-quality GO-CAM model that effectively captures the current understanding of DEPTOR regulation by MAPK3/ERK1 and USP7.\n",

      "\n",
      "## General Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model titled \"Inhibition of the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling following phosphorylation of FNIP1 by AMPK in response to mitochondrial stress (Human)\" represents a well-constructed pathway describing how mitochondrial stress triggers AMPK phosphorylation of FNIP1, which in turn inhibits the FLCN-FNIP1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) complex, leading to changes in RagC nucleotide status and ultimately affecting the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pathway Logic**: The model effectively captures the causal cascade from AMPK activation to downstream transcription factor regulation, with appropriate directional relationships using RO terms such as RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) and RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular Detail**: The model correctly includes key proteins (FNIP1, FLCN, RagC, mTOR) with their appropriate molecular functions and subcellular localizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence**: Each activity and relationship is supported by evidence from published literature, primarily using direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) with appropriate PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Context**: The model accurately captures the lysosomal localization (GO:0005765) of many components, which is essential for mTORC1 signaling regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: The FLCN-FNIP1 complex is presented as separate entities rather than using a complex representation. While this is acceptable according to the complex annotation guidelines when the individual activities are known, it might be clearer to explicitly show their interaction as a complex since their function as a GAP is dependent on their association.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Phosphorylation Representation**: While the title mentions FNIP1 phosphorylation by AMPK, the specific phosphorylation sites (Ser220, Ser230, Ser232, Ser261, and Ser593) that are critical for regulation, as shown in the PMID:37079666 paper, could be more explicitly captured in the model annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Temporal Dynamics**: The model doesn't fully capture the temporal dynamics of the pathway - specifically that FNIP1 phosphorylation leads to an initial wave of lysosomal biogenesis followed by a later wave of mitochondrial biogenesis, as described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of this pathway based on the literature. Key features correctly captured include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. AMPK (PRKAA1) directly phosphorylates FNIP1, inhibiting the GAP activity of the FLCN-FNIP1 complex\n",
      "\n",
      "2. FLCN functions as a GTPase activator protein (GO:0005096) for RagC, which is accurately represented\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The localization of these activities to the lysosomal membrane is correctly annotated\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The downstream effects on transcription factors (TFEB and TFE3) are appropriately represented\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Enhancement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Additional Components**: Consider including the final transcriptional targets of TFEB/TFE3 that drive lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis to complete the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include Alternative Regulatory Mechanisms**: The model could be expanded to show how amino acid availability regulates the same pathway differently than energetic stress, as described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cross-Reference Related Models**: Link to other GO-CAM models that represent related processes like canonical mTORC1 signaling or the broader AMPK response to energetic stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarify Relationship Between RagC and mTOR**: The connection between RagC's nucleotide status and mTOR activity could be more explicitly represented through additional annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (648d0dc100001272) provides a well-constructed and biologically accurate representation of non-canonical mTORC1 signaling regulation following AMPK phosphorylation of FNIP1 in response to mitochondrial stress. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices and effectively captures the key molecular players and their interactions. The minor improvements suggested would further enhance its comprehensiveness and clarity but do not diminish the value of the current representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully demonstrates how mitochondrial stress leads to AMPK activation, FNIP1 phosphorylation, inhibition of FLCN-FNIP1 GAP activity, alteration of RagC GTP/GDP binding, and ultimately regulation of transcription factors that control lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the TRAF7-mediated modulation of NF-kappa-B signaling through K29-linked ubiquitination of IKBKG (NEMO) and RelA proteins in humans. The model depicts the pathway by which TRAF7 negatively regulates NF-kappa-B activation through a non-degradative K29-linked ubiquitination mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content and Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model's biological content is generally accurate and consistent with the literature evidence provided. The key findings represented in this model are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TRAF7 exhibits E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) that targets IKBKG (NEMO) for K29-linked ubiquitination.\n",
      "2. This ubiquitination doesn't lead to proteasomal degradation but rather to lysosomal degradation, as indicated by the associated process \"protein K29-linked ubiquitination\" (GO:0035519).\n",
      "3. TRAF7 activity represses NF-kappaB activation by reducing the activity of both IKBKG and RELA.\n",
      "4. The model correctly shows IKBKG as a signaling adaptor in the canonical NF-kappa-B pathway.\n",
      "5. The model properly captures the protein sequestering activity of NFKBIA (IκBα) in inhibiting RELA and NFKB1 activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings align with the Uniprot information for [TRAF7 (Q6Q0C0)](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q6Q0C0), which states it \"promotes 'Lys-29'-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO/IKBKG and RELA leading to targeting these two proteins to lysosomal degradative pathways, reducing the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correct use of causal relationships**: The model uses the appropriate predicate \"RO:0002630\" (directly negatively regulates) between activities in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate annotation of ubiquitination activities**: TRAF7's E3 ligase activity is correctly annotated with GO:0061630 and appropriately associated with the biological process GO:0035519 (protein K29-linked ubiquitination), following the guidelines for annotating E3 ubiquitin ligases.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper annotation of protein sequestering activity**: NFKBIA's (IκBα) protein sequestering activity (GO:0140311) is appropriately used to represent its inhibition of NF-kB components, consistent with the \"Protein sequestering activity\" guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Correct cytoplasmic localization**: The activities are correctly localized to the appropriate cellular compartments (cytoplasm and nucleus).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing direct ubiquitination of RELA**: While the Uniprot entry for TRAF7 indicates it also targets RELA for K29-linked polyubiquitination, the model only shows the indirect regulation of RELA activity via the NFKBIA sequestering activity. Consider adding a direct ubiquitination relationship between TRAF7 and RELA to better reflect the complete mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete molecular mechanisms between IKBKG and IKK kinases**: The model shows IKBKG (NEMO) as a target of TRAF7, but doesn't fully capture how IKBKG modulates the activities of CHUK (IKKα) and IKBKB (IKKβ). Consider adding more detailed interactions showing how IKBKG regulates these kinases.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing contextual specificity**: The model would benefit from adding information about the cellular conditions or stimuli that trigger this pathway. This would provide better context for when this negative regulation occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **PMID missing reference format issue**: One evidence citation (PMID:21518757) is missing the \"PMID:\" prefix in the occurs_in evidence for TRAF7 activity. This should be corrected to maintain consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Validation of input-output relationships**: While the model correctly uses \"directly negatively regulates\" predicates, it should be verified that the \"has input\" relationships are also present where appropriate (e.g., for TRAF7's E3 ligase activity targeting IKBKG).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the role of TRAF7 in negatively regulating NF-kappa-B signaling through K29-linked ubiquitination of IKBKG. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices for representing E3 ligase activities and protein sequestering activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minor issues noted above could be addressed to make the model more comprehensive and to better represent the full spectrum of TRAF7's activities in modulating NF-kappa-B signaling. With these refinements, the model would provide an even more accurate representation of this important regulatory mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with current knowledge of NF-kappa-B regulation and the role of K29-linked ubiquitination in protein trafficking to lysosomal degradation rather than proteasomal degradation, which represents an important regulatory mechanism in NF-kappa-B signaling.\n",

      "## GO-CAM Review: MPEG1/perforin-2 forms a pore for to deliver antigens for cross-presentation (Human)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:6494e2e900001496](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6494e2e900001496)) describes how MPEG1/perforin-2 forms a pore to facilitate antigen delivery for cross-presentation in dendritic cells. The model represents the pathway involving three key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004197) by LGMN (UniProtKB:Q99538)\n",
      "2. Wide pore channel activity (GO:0022829) by MPEG1 (UniProtKB:Q2M385)\n",
      "3. Peptide antigen binding (GO:0042605) by Tapbp (MGI:MGI:1201689, mouse protein)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Process Context\n",
      "- LGMN (legumain) participates in protein maturation (GO:0051604)\n",
      "- MPEG1 (perforin-2) participates in antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I (GO:0042590)\n",
      "- Tapbp (tapasin) participates in antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I, TAP-dependent (GO:0002479)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "- LGMN directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) MPEG1\n",
      "- MPEG1 provides input for (RO:0002413) Tapbp\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly captures the recent findings that perforin-2 (MPEG1) forms pores in antigen-containing compartments to facilitate cross-presentation, with LGMN (asparagine endopeptidase) playing a role in perforin-2 maturation, as supported by the literature (PMID:37347855).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate relationships**: The causal relationships are appropriately represented with LGMN directly positively regulating MPEG1 (via proteolytic processing) and MPEG1 providing input for Tapbp.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular context**: The model correctly identifies that MPEG1 occurs in the phagocytic vesicle membrane (GO:0030670), which is consistent with its biological function.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Issues and Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use of mouse protein in human model**: The model uses a mouse tapasin protein (MGI:MGI:1201689) while claiming to be a human model. It would be more appropriate to use the human ortholog (UniProtKB:O15533).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence codes**: The evidence for MPEG1's pore activity is appropriate (ECO:0000314 \"direct assay evidence\") with citation to PMID:31537793, but some relationships rely on sequence similarity evidence with mouse (ECO:0000250). While the mouse data is strong, human-specific evidence would strengthen the model when available.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing components**: The model could be expanded to include:\n",
      "   - The complete process of cross-presentation, including the proteasome and TAP components\n",
      "   - MHC class I molecules that ultimately present the antigens\n",
      "   - The role of dendritic cells (which could be specified as a cell type context)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential redundancy**: There appears to be a duplicated causal association between LGMN and MPEG1, with the same predicate (RO:0002629) appearing twice with the same evidence for one instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Model title grammar**: The title \"MPEG1/perforin-2 forms a pore for to deliver antigens for cross-presentation\" contains a grammatical error (\"for to deliver\").\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Mechanism Details\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the literature (PMID:37347855), the model accurately captures a recently discovered mechanism:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Legumain (LGMN/AEP) mediates proteolytic processing of perforin-2 (MPEG1) in the lysosome/endosome\n",
      "2. This processing releases the pore-forming domain of MPEG1, allowing it to form pores in the membrane of antigen-containing compartments\n",
      "3. These pores facilitate the escape of antigens into the cytosol, where they can be processed by the proteasome\n",
      "4. Tapasin (Tapbp) then assists in loading peptides onto MHC class I molecules for cross-presentation\n",
      "\n",
      "This mechanism represents an important insight into dendritic cell cross-presentation that was only recently discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Model Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Replace the mouse tapasin protein with its human ortholog\n",
      "2. Fix the duplicate causal association between LGMN and MPEG1\n",
      "3. Consider adding dendritic cells as a cell type context\n",
      "4. Expand the model to include downstream components of the cross-presentation pathway\n",
      "5. Correct the grammatical error in the title\n",
      "6. Consider adding additional evidence from human studies when available\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model successfully captures the novel mechanism of perforin-2-mediated antigen cross-presentation as described in recent literature. It accurately represents the roles of legumain in perforin-2 processing and perforin-2 in forming pores for antigen escape. With the suggested refinements, this model would provide an even more comprehensive and accurate representation of this important immunological process.\n",

      "These causal relationships accurately reflect the signaling flow described in the literature, particularly in PMID:26166747 which describes how BMAL1/CLOCK generates circadian rhythm of C/EBPalpha-mediated leptin transcription in adipose tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Biological Processes\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are appropriately tagged with the biological process \"energy homeostasis\" ([GO:0097009](https://bioregistry.io/go:0097009)), with BMAL1 additionally being part of \"circadian regulation of gene expression\" ([GO:0032922](https://bioregistry.io/go:0032922)). This is consistent with the model's focus on how SUCNR1 controls energy homeostasis through circadian clock regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Evidence Codes\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes:\n",
      "- Evidence from direct assays (ECO:0000314) with references to relevant PMIDs\n",
      "- Evidence from sequence similarity (ECO:0000250) with references to mouse orthologs\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional Context for BMAL1 Function**: According to the transcription coregulator activity guidelines, BMAL1's activity could include more context about its specific role. The literature indicates that BMAL1 forms a heterodimer with CLOCK, which is not explicitly represented in the model. The model could potentially be enhanced by including CLOCK as part of a complex with BMAL1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Specificity of Causal Relationships**: The causal relationship between CEBPA and LEP is currently \"provides input for\", but the literature shows that CEBPA is a transcription factor that directly activates leptin transcription. A more specific relationship such as \"directly positively regulates\" might be more appropriate here.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Component**: The literature indicates that succinate (CHEBI:30031) is the ligand for SUCNR1, but this small molecule activator is not included in the model. According to the guidelines, ligand activation should be captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Anatomical Context**: While the model title mentions adipocytes, the cellular components are specified but not the cell type context. Adding white adipocyte (CL:0000448) as an additional context could enhance the specificity of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, [GO-CAM model 6494e2e900002525](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6494e2e900002525) is a well-constructed representation of how SUCNR1 signaling controls energy homeostasis through the regulation of leptin via circadian clock components. The model accurately captures the key players and their interactions in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows most GO-CAM best practices and provides a clear visualization of the molecular pathway. The causal relationships between activities are properly established, and the evidence is well-documented with appropriate references to the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "With minor refinements regarding the addition of CLOCK as a BMAL1 partner, the inclusion of succinate as a SUCNR1 activator, and potentially more specific relationship types, this model would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important biological pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the molecular pathway involved in skeletal muscle acetylcholine-gated channel clustering in the mouse neuromuscular junction. The model focuses on the signaling pathway from Agrin (Agrn) through MuSK (Muscle skeletal receptor tyrosine kinase) and downstream effectors leading to Rac1 activation and acetylcholine receptor clustering.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context\n",
      "The model correctly captures a well-established neuromuscular junction formation pathway, where:\n",
      "1. Agrin (secreted by motor neurons) acts as a receptor ligand that binds to Lrp4\n",
      "2. Lrp4 acts as a coreceptor that stimulates MuSK phosphorylation\n",
      "3. MuSK signals through adaptor proteins (Dok7, Crk, Crkl) \n",
      "4. This signaling ultimately leads to Rac1 activation and cytoskeletal reorganization\n",
      "5. These events result in acetylcholine receptor clustering at the neuromuscular junction\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate core pathway representation**: The model correctly depicts the established Agrin-MuSK-Dok7-Rac1 pathway that is essential for neuromuscular junction formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal associations**: The model uses the correct causal connections between activities, utilizing \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) relationships where appropriate to show the signaling flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Comprehensive molecular functions**: The model includes the essential molecular functions like receptor ligand activity (Agrin), protein tyrosine kinase activity (MuSK), coreceptor activity (Lrp4), signaling adaptor activity (Dok7, Crk, Crkl), and G protein activity (Rac1).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper cellular localization**: The model correctly places components in their appropriate cellular compartments (e.g., extracellular space for Agrin, postsynaptic membrane for MuSK).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Well-supported with evidence**: Each assertion in the model is supported by experimental evidence, mostly from direct assays (ECO:0000314) and genetic interaction experiments (ECO:0000316), with appropriate citations to the primary literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rapsn role clarity**: The model includes Rapsn (receptor-associated protein of the synapse), which is known to be a critical adapter protein for acetylcholine receptor clustering, but does not connect it to the rest of the pathway via causal associations. Rapsn plays a critical role as a molecular adaptor in neuromuscular junction formation and should be causally connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Farp1 connection details**: The model includes Farp1 (FERM, ARH/RhoGEF and pleckstrin domain protein 1) as a guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor, but its connection to Rac1 could be more explicitly detailed with additional evidence, as it appears to be an important regulatory step in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing PTMs**: The model could include more post-translational modifications known to be important in this pathway, particularly the tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok7 (on Y396 and Y406) which is described in the primary literature as being essential for recruiting Crk and Crkl.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional biological processes**: The model focuses on positive regulation of Rac protein signal transduction (GO:0035022) and skeletal muscle acetylcholine-gated channel clustering (GO:0071340), but could also include related processes such as neuromuscular junction development (GO:0007528) to provide a more comprehensive picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Model Enhancement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add causal connection between Rapsn and downstream components**: Include a causal relationship between Rapsn's protein-macromolecule adaptor activity and the appropriate downstream activity, as Rapsn is essential for clustering acetylcholine receptors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expand Farp1 role**: Clarify the role of Farp1 as a guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1, perhaps with additional evidence from the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add tyrosine phosphorylation annotations**: Include annotations for the key tyrosine phosphorylation events, particularly for Dok7, which are crucial for recruiting Crk and Crkl.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Include neuromuscular junction development**: Add GO:0007528 (neuromuscular junction development) as an additional biological process to provide a more complete functional context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of skeletal muscle acetylcholine-gated channel clustering. The model captures the essential components and relationships of the pathway with appropriate evidence. The suggested improvements would further enhance the model's comprehensiveness and connectivity.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The model titled \"Positive regulation of acetylcholine receptor transcription (Mouse)\" (https://bioregistry.io/go.model:64c3044100000125) describes a signaling pathway in mouse muscle cells where Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) stimulates the transcription of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) genes through a MAP kinase cascade, ultimately leading to GABPA-mediated transcriptional activation. This pathway is important for neuromuscular junction development and synaptic function.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Strong Evidential Support**: The model is well-supported by multiple research papers (e.g., PMID:11318655, PMID:8702681) that provide experimental evidence for the pathway connections. The citations are used appropriately for each connection in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct Use of Molecular Functions**: The molecular functions assigned to each gene product (e.g., receptor ligand activity for NRG1, protein tyrosine kinase activity for ErbB2/3, etc.) are appropriate based on the scientific literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clear Pathway Flow**: The model presents a coherent signaling cascade from NRG1 binding to receptors through MAP kinase activation to transcriptional activation of AChR genes, which aligns with established literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate Causal Connections**: The model correctly uses the RO:0002629 (\"directly positively regulates\") predicate for causal relationships between activities in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Evidence for Some Causal Associations**: Some causal connections (between RAF1 and MAP2K1/MAP2K4) lack explicit evidence annotations. All causal associations should include supporting evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Component Annotations**: While some activities in the model have appropriate cellular component annotations (e.g., postsynaptic membrane for receptor activities), some intermediate steps in the pathway would benefit from more specific cellular localization.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Model Completeness**: The model could potentially benefit from including:\n",
      "   - The downstream effects of CHRNE (acetylcholine receptor subunit epsilon) activation\n",
      "   - A more explicit representation of how JNK cascade activation leads to MAPK8 activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current scientific understanding of NRG1-induced AChR transcription as described in the primary literature. Key highlights of the pathway include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **NRG1 Signaling Initiation**: The model correctly shows NRG1 (Mmus) activating neuregulin receptor activity of ErbB3, which occurs in the extracellular space.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Activation**: The model shows ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activation downstream of ErbB3, which is consistent with the literature showing ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimerization.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **MAPK Cascade**: The model accurately depicts the three-tier kinase cascade (RAF1 → MAP2K1/MAP2K4 → MAPK8) that is activated following receptor stimulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Transcription Factor Activation**: The model correctly shows MAPK8-mediated activation of GABPA, which then activates transcription of the acetylcholine receptor gene (CHRNE), as supported by PMID:11318655, which demonstrated that NRG1-induced phosphorylation of GABPA at threonine 280 contributes to AChR gene transcription.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices, particularly:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity Connections**: Activities are connected using appropriate predicates that reflect the biological relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence Documentation**: Most activities and connections are supported by appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complex Representation**: The model appropriately represents protein complexes by focusing on the specific activities of individual subunits rather than using complex terms, which is consistent with GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add evidence annotations to the causal associations between RAF1 (MGI:97847) and MAP2K1/MAP2K4, preferably from the cited literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider adding cellular component annotations for the MAP kinase cascade components to better represent their subcellular localization.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Consider adding information about the biological outcome of acetylcholine receptor activity in the context of neuromuscular junction function.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model presents a scientifically accurate representation of the NRG1-induced signaling pathway leading to acetylcholine receptor transcription in mouse muscle cells. The model is well-supported by experimental evidence and follows GO-CAM best practices. With minor enhancements as suggested above, the model would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important signaling pathway.\n",

      "   - The model correctly uses the \"directly positively regulates\" relation (RO:0002629) to connect BANF1's DNA binding activity to CGAS inhibition.\n",
      "   - This follows the guidelines in \"Regulation and Regulatory Processes in GO-CAM\" where the regulatory mechanism is known and has a specific effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Location Specification**:\n",

      "   - The model correctly captures BANF1's role in binding to DNA (GO:0003690) in the nucleus and its inhibitory effect on cGAS.\n",
      "   - This is consistent with the literature that describes BANF1 as outcompeting cGAS for DNA binding.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **cGAS Activities**:\n",
      "   - The model includes both cGAS's enzymatic activity (GO:0061501, 2',3'-cyclic GMP-AMP synthase activity) and its ability to form molecular condensates (GO:0140693).\n",
      "   - These activities are accurately represented as occurring in the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **STING1 Activities**:\n",
      "   - The model correctly depicts STING1's binding to cGAMP (GO:0061507) and signaling adaptor activity (GO:0035591) in the ER membrane.\n",
      "   - The causal relationships between STING1 activities are biologically accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal Flow**:\n",
      "   - The flow of causal relationships in the model accurately represents the biological process:\n",

      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Temporal Aspects**:\n",
      "   - The model could potentially benefit from additional information about when this inhibition is most critical (e.g., during mitosis or in response to certain cellular stresses).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Downstream Effects**:\n",
      "   - While the model focuses on the core regulatory mechanism, it could be expanded to include downstream effects of STING1 activation, such as TBK1 and IRF3 activation leading to interferon production.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cross-talk with Other Pathways**:\n",
      "   - The model could be enhanced by including connections to other regulatory pathways that might influence this process.\n",

      "## Summary of the Model Content\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the activation pathway of the cGAS-STING signaling cascade in humans, specifically focusing on how KAT5-mediated acetylation of cGAS enhances the innate immune response to DNA viruses. The model includes three main proteins:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **cGAS (UniProtKB:Q8N884)** - Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, the cytosolic DNA sensor\n",
      "2. **KAT5 (UniProtKB:Q92993-4)** - Histone acetyltransferase, which acetylates cGAS\n",

      "\n",
      "The model includes the following molecular activities and causal relationships:\n",
      "- KAT5 has peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity (GO:0061733)\n",
      "- KAT5 acetylates cGAS, which directly positively regulates cGAS DNA binding\n",

      "\n",
      "## Review Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "### Structural Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the key sequential elements of the cGAS activation pathway:\n",
      "1. KAT5 acetylates cGAS\n",
      "2. Acetylated cGAS binds to double-stranded DNA\n",
      "3. DNA binding enhances cGAS's ability to act as a molecular condensate scaffold\n",

      "\n",
      "### Evidence Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by scientific evidence, with all activities backed by experimental evidence:\n",
      "- All assertions are supported by experimental evidence (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- The model cites multiple peer-reviewed publications: PMID:32911482, PMID:32912999, PMID:31544964, PMID:32817552, PMID:30842659, PMID:30842662, and PMID:17360565\n",
      "- The evidence aligns with current understanding of cGAS activation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the current scientific understanding of cGAS activation as described in the cited literature. The cited papers provide strong evidence for:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The acetylation of cGAS by KAT5 (PMID:32817552)\n",
      "2. The importance of DNA binding for cGAS activation (PMID:32911482, PMID:32912999)\n",
      "3. The formation of molecular condensates by cGAS upon DNA binding (PMID:32911482)\n",
      "4. The connection between these activities and the cGAS-STING signaling pathway (PMID:31544964)\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal relationships**: The model properly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) to connect the activities in the causal chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular location**: All activities correctly specify their cellular locations (nucleus - GO:0005634).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular activities**: The model appropriately assigns molecular functions to each protein - peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity to KAT5, and double-stranded DNA binding, molecular condensate scaffold activity, and 2',3'-cyclic GMP-AMP synthase activity to cGAS.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Part-of relations**: Activities are correctly connected to the biological process \"cGAS/STING signaling pathway\" (GO:0140896) using part_of relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Potential Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is accurate and well-constructed, there are a few areas that could be enhanced:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Specific acetylation sites**: The model could be more specific about which lysine residues of cGAS are acetylated by KAT5. According to PMID:32817552, KAT5 acetylates specific lysine residues in the N-terminus of cGAS (K47, K56, K62, and K83). Adding this information would increase the model's precision.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular mechanism details**: The model could potentially include additional details about how acetylation enhances DNA binding, such as by explaining that acetylation of N-terminal lysines increases the DNA binding affinity of cGAS.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream effects**: While the model shows the activation of cGAS's 2',3'-cyclic GMP-AMP synthase activity, it doesn't show the production of cGAMP and its effects on STING. Including these downstream steps would make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Nuclear localization vs. cytosolic activity**: Recent literature suggests that cGAS can be found in both the nucleus (bound to nucleosomes, which inhibits its activity) and the cytosol (where it's activated by foreign DNA). The model shows all activities occurring in the nucleus, but it might be more accurate to indicate that while cGAS is found in the nucleus, its actual DNA-sensing activity against viral DNA typically occurs in the cytosol.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "GO-CAM model 64d5781900000111 is a scientifically accurate and well-constructed representation of the KAT5-mediated activation of cGAS in the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. The model appropriately uses GO terms and relations to capture the causal relationships between molecular activities, and is well-supported by experimental evidence from peer-reviewed publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures how KAT5 acetylates cGAS, which enhances cGAS's ability to bind double-stranded DNA, form molecular condensates, and synthesize 2',3'-cyclic GMP-AMP to activate the STING pathway. This pathway is crucial for innate immune responses to DNA viruses and cytosolic self-DNA.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a few minor enhancements to include more specific details about acetylation sites and subcellular location of activities, this model would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important signaling pathway.\n",

      "## Scientific Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of cGAS activation and its inhibition by TREX1:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **cGAS Activation Mechanism**: The model correctly shows that double-stranded DNA binding by cGAS leads to its molecular condensate scaffold activity, which then enables its enzymatic function to produce cGAMP. This is consistent with recent literature showing that cGAS undergoes phase separation upon DNA binding, which is crucial for its activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **TREX1 Inhibitory Role**: The model correctly represents TREX1's role in degrading cytosolic DNA, which prevents cGAS from binding to DNA and becoming activated. This is consistent with research showing that TREX1 prevents inappropriate activation of the cGAS-STING pathway by self-DNA.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subcellular Locations**: The model accurately represents the subcellular locations - cGAS activities in the cytosol and TREX1 activity at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Consistency with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Activities**: Each protein is appropriately annotated with its specific molecular function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Connections**: The causal relationships between molecular activities are represented using appropriate relationship types (RO:0002629 for 'directly positively regulates' and RO:0012010 for causal relationship from TREX1 to cGAS).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence**: All annotations are supported by appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well constructed, I've identified a few potential areas for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **TREX1 Mechanism Clarification**: The connection between TREX1 and cGAS DNA binding uses RO:0012010, which isn't one of the standard causal relationship predicates mentioned in your guidelines (RO:0002413, RO:0002629, RO:0002630, RO:0002304, RO:0002305). A more standard predicate like RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) might be more appropriate to represent TREX1's inhibitory effect on cGAS DNA binding.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular Complexes**: The model represents individual proteins rather than complexes. This is appropriate in this case since each protein's distinct activity is known, but it might be worth clarifying if TREX1 functions as a dimer or if other components are involved in its regulation of cGAS.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological Context**: The model could potentially be expanded to include additional context, such as the downstream consequences of cGAMP production (activation of STING) and the resulting immune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Feedback Regulation**: The model could potentially be enhanced by including any known feedback mechanisms regulating either cGAS or TREX1 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Literature Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by recent literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The papers cited (PMID:32911482, PMID:32912999) provide strong structural evidence for how cGAS binds to DNA and how this binding is regulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The references support the key biological assertions made in the model about the relationships between DNA binding, phase separation (molecular condensate scaffold activity), and enzymatic function of cGAS.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The inhibitory role of TREX1 is supported by the cited literature, though I couldn't access the full text of PMID:33476576 to verify all details.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:64d5781900000443) provides an accurate and well-structured representation of the inhibition of cGAS-STING signaling by TREX1 in human cells. The model effectively captures the key molecular activities and causal relationships in this pathway, with strong supporting evidence from the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be slightly improved by clarifying the causal relationship predicate used for TREX1's effect on cGAS, and potentially expanded to include additional context about downstream signaling and feedback regulation.

      "### Title and Overall Description\n",
      "The model titled \"Activation of canonical mTORC1 following glycosylation of RPTOR by OGT in response to glucose sufficiency (Human)\" represents a molecular mechanism of mTORC1 (mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) activation through glycosylation of the RPTOR component by OGT (O-GlcNAc transferase) in response to glucose. This signaling pathway is important for cellular growth, metabolism regulation, and protein synthesis in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Accuracy and Biological Content\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model has been constructed with detailed and accurate biological information. It correctly represents:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The central role of RPTOR (Raptor) glycosylation in mTORC1 activation** - The model correctly captures how O-GlcNAcylation of RPTOR by OGT at Thr-700 (as shown in PMID:37541260) facilitates interaction with Rag GTPases and promotes translocation to lysosomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The Rag GTPase involvement** - The model accurately represents RRAGA (RagA) and RRAGC (RagC) roles in regulating mTORC1 localization to lysosomes following glucose signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The activation of MTOR kinase activity** - Following proper localization, the model correctly shows how RHEB activates MTOR's protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674), which then phosphorylates downstream targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Downstream effectors** - The model includes the key mTORC1 substrates including EIF4EBP1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2), linking mTORC1 to translational control.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices with a few points to note:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal relationships** - The model appropriately uses causal predicates (particularly RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\") to connect activities in a biologically meaningful way.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Subcellular locations** - Correct use of cellular component terms for the lysosomal membrane (GO:0005765) and cytosol (GO:0005829) reflecting the importance of mTORC1 translocation from cytosol to lysosome for activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complex representation** - The model follows the guidelines in \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" by correctly representing individual protein components of mTORC1 with their specific activities rather than using a complex term, as the activities of specific subunits (e.g., RPTOR and MTOR) are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence codes and references** - Each activity and causal relationship is properly supported with evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence) and PMID citations, which I've verified contain the relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Positive Aspects\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the recent finding that OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of RPTOR at Thr-700 is a key mechanism for translating glucose signals to mTORC1 (PMID:37541260).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. It includes not just the core pathway but also the downstream effects on translational machinery, providing a more complete biological story.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Evidence codes are consistently and appropriately applied throughout the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The model properly represents the subcellular localization changes that are crucial for mTORC1 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Minor Issues/Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Glucose sensing mechanism** - While the model shows OGT responding to glucose stimulus (GO:0071333), it might be valuable to include more detail on how glucose levels are sensed upstream of OGT.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **AMPK regulation** - The model doesn't include the counteracting role of AMPK, which phosphorylates RPTOR at Ser-722 and Ser-792 to inhibit O-GlcNAcylation during glucose starvation (as mentioned in PMID:37541260). Including this would provide a more complete picture of the bidirectional regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **mTORC1 dimerization** - Recent structural studies (PMID:29236692) indicate that mTORC1 functions as a dimer, and RHEB binding appears to be cooperative. This aspect of mTORC1 regulation could be represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is a high-quality representation of current knowledge about mTORC1 activation via RPTOR glycosylation by OGT in response to glucose. It accurately captures the molecular mechanisms described in the literature, particularly the recent findings from PMID:37541260, and follows GO-CAM curation best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully connects glucose sensing to translational regulation through a well-documented series of causal events, making it useful for researchers interested in nutrient sensing, mTOR signaling, and translational control. The minor suggestions noted above could further enhance what is already a comprehensive and accurate model.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model ID: [gomodel:64d5781900002033](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:64d5781900002033)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the pathway by which insulin stimulates neurite outgrowth through the activation of ARF6-RAC1 signaling, mediated by the neuronal adapter protein FE65 (APBB1) and atypical protein kinase C iota (PRKCI). The model consists of a chain of molecular activities that forms a signaling cascade from insulin hormone activity in the extracellular space to G protein activity in the cytosol, ultimately contributing to positive regulation of neuron projection development.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following key proteins:\n",
      "1. **Insulin (INS)** - [UniProtKB:P01308](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:P01308)\n",
      "2. **Protein kinase C iota (PRKCI)** - [UniProtKB:P41743](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:P41743)\n",
      "3. **Amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 1 (APBB1/FE65)** - [UniProtKB:O00213](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:O00213)\n",
      "4. **ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6)** - [UniProtKB:P62330](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:P62330)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Molecular Function Activities and Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Insulin (INS)** performs hormone activity (GO:0005179) in the extracellular space (GO:0005615), which activates (RO:0002407) the protein serine/threonine kinase activity of PRKCI.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Protein kinase C iota (PRKCI)** performs protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) in the cytosol (GO:0005829), which directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) the molecular adaptor activity of APBB1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **APBB1/FE65** performs molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737), which directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) the G protein activity of ARF6.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **ARF6** performs G protein activity (GO:0003925) in the cytosol (GO:0005829).\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are part of the biological process of positive regulation of neuron projection development (GO:0010976).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strength and Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model aligns well with the latest research on insulin's role in neurite outgrowth. The key paper (PMID:36250347) describes how insulin stimulates atypical protein kinase C (PRKCI)-mediated phosphorylation of the neuronal adaptor FE65 to potentiate neurite outgrowth by activating ARF6-Rac1 signaling, which is accurately captured in this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence support**: Each component and relationship is supported by experimental evidence from appropriate publications (e.g., PMID:36250347, PMID:14986111, PMID:8226978, PMID:18468999).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Annotation quality**: The molecular functions are appropriately assigned to each protein based on their documented activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing component**: The model omits RAC1, which is mentioned in the title and is a critical downstream component in this pathway. According to PMID:36250347, ARF6 activates RAC1, which then contributes to neurite outgrowth. I recommend adding RAC1 and its GTPase activity as a downstream element activated by ARF6.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationship redundancy**: There appears to be a redundant causal association between PRKCI and APBB1. The model shows two identical RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) relationships from PRKCI to APBB1, one of which lacks evidence. This duplicate should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular component precision**: While ARF6 is annotated to the cytosol (GO:0005829), the literature (PMID:14978216, PMID:32103017) indicates its activity also occurs at the plasma membrane and in cell projections when involved in neurite outgrowth. Consider adding more specific cellular locations for ARF6 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular mechanism details**: The specific phosphorylation of APBB1 at Serine 459 by PRKCI is an important mechanistic detail from PMID:36250347 that could be more clearly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pathway completeness**: The model could benefit from including the activation of PRKCI by insulin signaling intermediates, as this is not a direct interaction. Consider adding the insulin receptor and relevant signaling components between insulin and PRKCI.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model follows the GO-CAM guidelines for representing a causal chain of molecular activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The use of \"part_of\" to connect all activities to the biological process (GO:0010976) is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The \"occurs_in\" relationships correctly specify cellular components for each activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The causal relationships use appropriate relation ontology terms (RO:0002407 and RO:0002629).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The representation of complexes is not applicable in this model since no complexes are involved in the pathway as currently modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a good representation of insulin-mediated activation of ARF6 in neurite outgrowth. It captures the core signaling cascade from insulin to ARF6 through PRKCI and APBB1, with appropriate molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships. To improve the model's completeness and accuracy, I recommend adding RAC1 as a downstream component, removing the redundant causal relationship, specifying the phosphorylation of APBB1 at Ser459, and considering more precise cellular locations for ARF6. These changes would make the model more informative and better aligned with the current understanding of this signaling pathway.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model (ID: [gomodel:64e7eefa00000854](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:64e7eefa00000854)) represents the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway in mouse. The model accurately portrays TNF-mediated signaling, starting with TNF ligand binding to its receptor, followed by recruitment of adaptor proteins, and culminating in the activation of the NF-κB pathway. The model includes both the positive regulatory aspects of the pathway and negative regulation elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pathway Completeness**: The model provides a comprehensive view of the TNF signaling pathway from receptor binding through downstream effectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidential Support**: Almost all interactions are backed by appropriate experimental evidence, primarily from research papers, with proper ECO codes for the type of evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular Functions**: The molecular functions assigned to proteins are appropriate (e.g., TNF has receptor ligand activity, TNFR1 has signaling receptor activity, TRADD has signaling adaptor activity).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate Causal Relations**: The model uses appropriate causal relation predicates between activities (e.g., \"directly positively regulates\", \"provides input for\").\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Proper Biological Context**: Activities are correctly placed in the appropriate biological processes (GO:0043123 - positive regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Evidence**: There's one causal association missing evidence:\n",
      "   - The causal relation between Rnf31 (MGI:MGI:1934704) E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and Ripk1 (MGI:MGI:108212) signaling adaptor activity lacks evidence. Evidence should be added to support this interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complexity Annotation**:\n",
      "   - The NF-kappaB p50/p65 complex (GO:0035525) is appropriately represented as enabling DNA-binding transcription activator activity, consistent with the guidelines for complex annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Representation**:\n",
      "   - The LUBAC complex components are represented individually rather than as a complex, which is appropriate according to guidelines when the individual activities of each component are known.\n",
      "   - Rbck1 (MGI:MGI:1344372) with ubiquitin ligase activator activity, Sharpin (MGI:MGI:1913331) with protein-macromolecule adaptor activity, and Rnf31 (MGI:MGI:1934704) with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity are all correctly annotated according to the E3 ubiquitin ligase guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **BP Context Consistency**: \n",
      "   - Most activities are part of \"positive regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction\" (GO:0043123), which is appropriate.\n",
      "   - However, some ubiquitination-related activities are correctly placed in \"protein polyubiquitination\" (GO:0000209), providing appropriate context for these activities.\n",
      "   - Nfkbia (MGI:MGI:104741) is correctly placed in \"negative regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction\" (GO:0043124).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Receptor Activity Annotation**:\n",
      "   - The TNF receptor (Tnfrsf1a) and ligand (Tnf) interactions follow the guidelines for protein ligand-activated signaling receptor annotation.\n",
      "   - The relationship between ligand and receptor activity uses \"directly positively regulates\" as recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Signaling Adaptors Representation**:\n",
      "   - The model includes multiple signaling adaptors (TRADD, TRAF2, RIP1) which are correctly annotated with \"signaling adaptor activity\" (GO:0035591).\n",
      "   - The causal relationships between these adaptors follow appropriate chain of activation as described in literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Review:\n",
      "\n",
      "According to GO-CAM guidelines:\n",
      "1. **Complex annotation**: Correctly implemented for the NF-κB complex.\n",
      "2. **Molecular adaptors**: Properly annotated with appropriate inputs and causal relations.\n",
      "3. **E3 ubiquitin ligases**: Correctly represented with proper functions and relations.\n",
      "4. **Signaling receptor activity**: TNF and TNFR1 interaction follows prescribed guidelines.\n",
      "5. **Causal relations**: Uses appropriate causal relations for regulatory relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Content Consistency:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the TNF signaling pathway as described in the literature. The referenced articles (especially PMID:18641653) support the role of TRADD as a critical adaptor in TNF signaling that orchestrates the formation of TNFR1 signaling complexes, which is reflected in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inclusion of negative regulation by Nfkbia (IκBα) provides appropriate regulatory balance to the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add evidence for the missing causal relation between Rnf31 and Ripk1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider adding more detailed information about the NF-κB-mediated transcriptional response, which could extend the model beyond signaling activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The current model focuses on the canonical NF-κB activation pathway. Consider adding elements of the non-canonical pathway if relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the TNF signaling pathway leading to NF-κB activation in mouse. It follows GO-CAM best practices for annotation of complexes, signaling receptors, E3 ubiquitin ligases, and adaptors. The model is parsimonious and provides a clear representation of the pathway that would be understandable to researchers familiar with signaling pathways.\n",

      "This model represents the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway via death domain receptors in mouse, focusing on the TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) pathway leading to apoptosis. The model captures the causal chain from TNF ligand binding to its receptor through adapter proteins to caspase activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Strengths\n",
      "1. **Appropriate pathway representation**: The model correctly captures the key components of the TNF-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway, from ligand-receptor binding to downstream signaling events.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular locations**: The model appropriately assigns cellular locations to the molecular functions, with TNF and its receptor at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886) and the adaptor proteins and caspases in the cytosol (GO:0005829).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationships (RO:0002413 \"provides input for\" and RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\") to connect the activities in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence support**: Most activities and causal links are supported by experimental evidence with appropriate ECO codes and PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. TNF Receptor Activity Annotation\n",
      "\n",
      "**Issue**: The TNF receptor (Tnfrsf1a) is correctly annotated with \"tumor necrosis factor receptor activity\" (GO:0005031) and is shown as regulated by TNF through the \"directly positively regulates\" relationship. However, the molecular function has no input specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: According to the signaling receptor activity guidelines, the receptor should have its downstream effector (TRADD in this case) as input. Modify the model to add \"has input\" relationship between the receptor activity and TRADD.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Missing Biological Process for TNF\n",
      "\n",
      "**Issue**: While TNF is annotated as part of \"positive regulation of execution phase of apoptosis\" (GO:1900119), it would be more accurate to also associate it with a more specific term related to TNF signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: Consider annotating TNF to \"tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway\" (GO:0033209) or a more specific child term to better reflect its primary role in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. TRADD and FADD Annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "**Issue**: Both TRADD and FADD are annotated with the generic \"signaling adaptor activity\" (GO:0035591), which is correct but could be more specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: Consider using a more specific child term like \"death domain binding\" (GO:0070513) for both proteins to better reflect their specific role in death receptor signaling. This would enhance the specificity of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. RIPK1 Protein Kinase Activity\n",
      "\n",
      "**Issue**: RIPK1 is correctly annotated with \"protein kinase activity\" (GO:0004672), but this is a broad term that doesn't capture its specific role.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: Consider using the more specific term \"protein serine/threonine kinase activity\" (GO:0004674) or even \"death domain containing receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase activity\" (GO:0097110) if appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Pathway Context\n",
      "\n",
      "**Issue**: The overall biological process for most activities is annotated as \"positive regulation of execution phase of apoptosis\" (GO:1900119), but the model actually represents the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: Consider annotating the activities to \"extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway\" (GO:0097191) or, more specifically, \"extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway via death domain receptors\" (GO:0008625), which would better reflect the primary biological process being modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Complex Annotation Issue\n",
      "\n",
      "**Issue**: According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, when the subunit carrying the molecular activity is known (as in this case), the complex is not described and the activity is represented by the specific protein carrying it. The model follows this guideline correctly, but it doesn't capture that TRADD, FADD, RIPK1, and Caspase-8 can form a complex called the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: While the current representation is valid, consider adding a note or comment indicating that these proteins form the DISC complex in this context. This would provide additional valuable information without changing the model structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, model [gomodel:64e7eefa00001233](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:64e7eefa00001233) is a well-structured representation of the TNF-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway in mouse. It correctly captures the key molecular functions, their cellular locations, and the causal relationships between them. The issues identified are mostly related to the specificity of the GO terms used and the context of the pathway, rather than fundamental errors in the model structure. \n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively shows how TNF binding to its receptor initiates a signaling cascade through TRADD, RIPK1, and FADD to activate Caspase-8, ultimately leading to the execution phase of apoptosis. With the suggested improvements, the model would provide an even more precise and informative representation of this important biological pathway.\n",

      "Inhibition of ALKBH5 RNA demethylase activity by sumoylation in response to reactive oxygen species (Human)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "This model represents a molecular pathway showing how reactive oxygen species (ROS) lead to the inhibition of ALKBH5 RNA demethylase activity through a SUMOylation mechanism, which impacts RNA metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of five molecular activities:\n",
      "1. MAPK8/JNK1 protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "2. MAPK9/JNK2 protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "3. PIAS4 SUMO ligase activity (GO:0061665)\n",
      "4. SENP1 SUMO-specific endopeptidase activity (GO:0070139)\n",
      "5. ALKBH5 mRNA N6-methyladenosine dioxygenase activity (GO:1990931)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "- MAPK8/JNK1 and MAPK9/JNK2 kinases both provide input for (RO:0002413) PIAS4 SUMO ligase activity\n",
      "- PIAS4 SUMO ligase activity directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) ALKBH5 mRNA N6-methyladenosine dioxygenase activity\n",
      "- SENP1 SUMO-specific endopeptidase activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) ALKBH5 mRNA N6-methyladenosine dioxygenase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Context\n",
      "- The MAPK8/JNK1 and MAPK9/JNK2 activities are part of cellular response to reactive oxygen species (GO:0034614)\n",
      "- PIAS4 and SENP1 activities are part of regulation of mRNA stability (GO:0043488)\n",
      "- ALKBH5 activity is part of mRNA destabilization (GO:0061157)\n",
      "- ALKBH5 activity occurs in nuclear speck (GO:0016607)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scientific Support\n",
      "The model is based primarily on evidence from PMID:34048572, which demonstrates that:\n",
      "1. ROS activates MAPK8/JNK1 and MAPK9/JNK2 kinases\n",
      "2. These kinases phosphorylate ALKBH5 at serine residues S87 and S325\n",
      "3. Phosphorylation facilitates ALKBH5 SUMOylation by PIAS4 at lysine residues K86 and K321\n",
      "4. SUMOylation inhibits ALKBH5's RNA demethylase activity by blocking its substrate accessibility\n",
      "5. SENP1 can desumoylate ALKBH5, restoring its RNA demethylase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also evidence from PMID:23177736 about ALKBH5's localization to nuclear speck.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the key molecular players and their activities in the ROS-induced SUMOylation of ALKBH5.\n",
      "2. The causal relationships between activities are supported by experimental evidence.\n",
      "3. The biological processes and cellular component annotations are appropriate.\n",
      "4. The model correctly uses the \"provides input for\" and \"directly regulates\" relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues to Address\n",
      "1. **Missing Components**: The model doesn't include ERK signaling, which according to PMID:34048572 is upstream of JNK and essential for the phosphorylation of ALKBH5.\n",
      "2. **Molecular Detail**: The specific phosphorylation sites (S87 and S325) and SUMOylation sites (K86 and K321) on ALKBH5 are not represented in the model.\n",
      "3. **Downstream Effects**: The model doesn't include the consequences of ALKBH5 inhibition on m6A levels and subsequent effects on DNA damage repair genes (FAAP20, ATRX, and RFC2).\n",
      "4. **Directness of Relationships**: The relationship between the JNK kinases and PIAS4 might be more accurately represented as indirect, since JNK phosphorylates ALKBH5, not PIAS4 directly.\n",
      "5. **Evidence Depth**: The evidence for SENP1's role could be strengthened, as its interaction with ALKBH5 is mentioned but less extensively characterized in the paper compared to PIAS4.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "1. Add the ERK kinase activity upstream of JNK kinases to complete the signaling pathway.\n",
      "2. Consider adding UBC9 (SUMO E2 conjugation enzyme) as a mediator between JNK and PIAS4, as the paper shows that phosphorylation enhances ALKBH5's interaction with UBC9.\n",
      "3. Add the downstream effects of ALKBH5 inhibition on m6A levels and DNA damage repair genes as this is a significant biological outcome of the pathway.\n",
      "4. Adjust the relationship between JNK kinases and PIAS4 to more accurately reflect the indirect nature of the interaction.\n",
      "5. Consider annotating the specific sites of phosphorylation and SUMOylation using annotations or notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:64e7eefa00001258 provides a good representation of the inhibition of ALKBH5 RNA demethylase activity by SUMOylation in response to reactive oxygen species. The model accurately depicts the key molecular players and their causal relationships. However, it could be improved by adding upstream ERK signaling, more molecular details about the phosphorylation and SUMOylation sites, downstream effects on m6A levels and DNA repair genes, and by refining the directness of some relationships. Overall, the model is scientifically sound and supported by experimental evidence.\n",

      "1. RBM33 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) ALKBH5's m6A demethylase activity\n",
      "2. RBM33 provides input for (RO:0002413) SENP1's desumoylase activity\n",
      "3. SENP1 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) ALKBH5's m6A demethylase activity\n",

      "## Evidence Sources\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is supported by evidence from the following primary research publications:\n",
      "- PMID:37257451 - Evidence for RBM33's role as an m6A reader and its regulation of ALKBH5\n",
      "- PMID:34048572 - Evidence for ALKBH5 regulation by sumoylation and SENP1's role\n",
      "- PMID:23177736 - Evidence for ALKBH5's localization in nuclear speck\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment of Model Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. **Completeness**: The model captures the essential components of the described pathway, including the key proteins (RBM33, ALKBH5, SENP1) and their functions.\n",
      "2. **Evidence Support**: All assertions are backed by published experimental evidence with appropriate citations and evidence codes.\n",
      "3. **Connectivity**: The causal connections between components are clearly defined using appropriate relationship predicates.\n",
      "4. **Biological Accuracy**: The model accurately represents the current understanding of m6A-mediated post-transcriptional regulation and is consistent with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "1. **Cellular Context**: While ALKBH5 is correctly annotated as occurring in nuclear speck (GO:0016607), the model could benefit from specifying the cellular locations of RBM33 and SENP1.\n",
      "2. **Downstream Effects**: The model could be expanded to show the downstream effects of m6A demethylation on specific target mRNAs and their biological consequences.\n",
      "3. **Regulatory Context**: The model does not capture potential upstream regulators of RBM33 function, which might provide additional context about when this pathway is activated.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Comparison with Related Models\n",
      "\n",
      "I reviewed a related model (gomodel:64e7eefa00001258 - \"Inhibition of ALKBH5 RNA demethylase activity by sumoylation in response to reactive oxygen species\") which provides complementary information about ALKBH5 regulation. That model shows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A parallel regulatory pathway where reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate MAPK8/9 kinases\n",
      "2. MAPK8/9 activate PIAS4, which then negatively regulates ALKBH5 through SUMOylation\n",
      "3. This results in decreased ALKBH5 activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The current model (gomodel:64e7eefa00001299) shows the reverse process, where SENP1 removes those SUMO modifications, enhancing ALKBH5 activity, and RBM33 serves as a reader that guides ALKBH5 to its target mRNAs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "1. Using appropriate relationship predicates for causal connections\n",
      "2. Including cellular components for relevant activities\n",
      "3. Annotating activities with the correct molecular function terms\n",
      "4. Using proper evidence codes and references\n",
      "5. Using cellular context and biological process annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Significance\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents an important post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in eukaryotic mRNAs and affects various aspects of RNA metabolism including stability, splicing, and translation. The model explains how RBM33 functions as a reader protein that recognizes m6A-modified RNAs and recruits ALKBH5 to remove these modifications, thereby affecting mRNA stability and potentially gene expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interaction between RBM33, SENP1, and ALKBH5 provides a nuanced mechanism for the selective demethylation of m6A-marked transcripts, which could be relevant in various biological contexts including cancer biology as suggested by the evidence papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Enhancement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider including specific target mRNAs that are regulated by this pathway, if known.\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed model that captures the key molecular interactions between ALKBH5, PSPC1, KAT8, and HDAC7 in the context of paraspeckle assembly. The model accurately represents recent scientific findings regarding ALKBH5's role in RNA m6A demethylation and how this activity is regulated by post-translational modifications (specifically acetylation at K235).\n",

      "### Key Components and Their Activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ALKBH5 (UniProtKB:Q6P6C2)**\n",

      "   - Provides input for ALKBH5's RNA N6-methyladenosine dioxygenase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Consistency with Literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with recent scientific discoveries, particularly the findings published in:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PMID:37474102 - Which describes ALKBH5's role in paraspeckle assembly through its C-terminal intrinsically disordered region that promotes phase separation.\n",
      "2. PMID:37369679 - Which details the regulation of ALKBH5's m6A demethylation activity through K235 acetylation by KAT8 and deacetylation by HDAC7, as well as its interaction with PSPC1.\n",
      "3. PMID:22416126 - Which describes the structural basis of PSPC1 in paraspeckle formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships between the activities (KAT8 → ALKBH5 → PSPC1) are accurately represented, reflecting the findings that KAT8-mediated acetylation of ALKBH5 promotes its interaction with PSPC1, which in turn facilitates RNA m6A recognition and demethylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model properly uses the following causal relationships:\n",
      "- `RO:0002629` (directly positively regulates) - for KAT8's acetylation effect on ALKBH5\n",
      "- `RO:0012010` (directly negatively regulates) - for HDAC7's deacetylation effect on ALKBH5\n",
      "- `RO:0002413` (provides input for) - for PSPC1's role in facilitating ALKBH5's activity\n",

      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is quite comprehensive, there are a few potential areas for enhancement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional context information**: The model could benefit from including the specific condition of hypoxia that was shown to promote ALKBH5 condensation and paraspeckle assembly as described in PMID:37474102.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Annotation of NEAT1**: The model could include the NEAT1 long non-coding RNA, which is an essential component of paraspeckles and whose stabilization by ALKBH5-mediated m6A demethylation is crucial for paraspeckle assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Specification of K235 as the acetylation site**: While the model correctly captures the acetylation relationship, it might be helpful to specify that K235 is the specific site of acetylation that affects ALKBH5 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional downstream effects**: The model could potentially include the downstream effects of ALKBH5-mediated paraspeckle assembly on cellular processes such as RNA processing and cancer cell invasion as described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The model gomodel:64e7eefa00001978 effectively captures the molecular mechanisms of ALKBH5 regulation through acetylation/deacetylation and its role in paraspeckle assembly. It accurately represents the current scientific understanding of these processes as described in recent literature. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing protein complexes and molecular activities, with appropriate evidence codes and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be further enhanced by including additional contextual information (hypoxia), the role of NEAT1, specific acetylation site details, and downstream effects, but these are refinements rather than corrections to an already well-constructed representation.\n",

      "The model \"[Phosphorylation-mediated interactions with TOPBP1 couples TP53BP1 and 9-1-1 in DNA damage checkpoint (Human)](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:65039e8700000055)\" represents critical molecular interactions in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. The model focuses on how phosphorylation of TP53BP1 (53BP1) and RAD9A (part of the 9-1-1 complex) enables both proteins to interact with TOPBP1, leading to activation of the ATR kinase in the G1 DNA damage checkpoint response.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **RNF168** (UniProtKB:Q8IYW5) with histone H2AK15 ubiquitin ligase activity (GO:0140858)\n",
      "2. **TP53BP1** (UniProtKB:Q12888) with histone reader activity (GO:0140566)\n",
      "3. **TOPBP1** (UniProtKB:Q92547) with chromatin-protein adaptor activity (GO:0140463)\n",
      "4. **RAD9A** (part of the 9-1-1 complex) (UniProtKB:Q99638) with molecular function activity (GO:0140031)\n",
      "5. **ATR** (UniProtKB:Q13535) with protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Process Representation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts the G1 DNA damage checkpoint pathway where:\n",
      "- RNF168 enables histone H2AK15 ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "- This provides input for TP53BP1's histone reader activity\n",
      "- TP53BP1 directly positively regulates TOPBP1's adaptor activity\n",
      "- RAD9A binds to phosphorylated proteins through its phosphorylation-dependent protein binding activity\n",
      "- TOPBP1 directly positively regulates ATR kinase activity\n",
      "- ATR enables protein serine/threonine kinase activity in DNA repair\n",
      "\n",
      "## Review Assessment and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate representation of molecular interactions**: The model correctly captures the phosphorylation-dependent interactions between TP53BP1, TOPBP1, and the 9-1-1 complex (including RAD9A).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper causal relationships**: The causal relationships using RO:0002413 (provides input for) and RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) are appropriately used to show the flow of information and activation in the checkpoint pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular location annotation**: Activities are properly annotated with location information, occurring at the site of double-strand break (GO:0035861).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process context**: Activities are connected to appropriate biological processes like double-strand break repair via classical nonhomologous end joining (GO:0097680).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence and references**: Each activity and causal link is supported by appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence) and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **9-1-1 Complex Representation**: While the model includes RAD9A, it doesn't explicitly represent that RAD9A is part of the 9-1-1 complex (which also includes RAD1 and HUS1). According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, when the subunit carrying the activity is known (as in this case with RAD9A), it's appropriate to use that subunit. However, it might be helpful to include a note or additional annotation indicating that RAD9A is part of the 9-1-1 complex for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Phosphorylation Sites**: The model would benefit from annotations specifying the exact phosphorylation sites on TP53BP1 (Ser-366 and Thr-670) and RAD9A (Ser-341 and Ser-387) that are critical for interaction with TOPBP1. This information is available in the references and would enhance the precision of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Downstream Effects**: The model currently shows ATR activation but could be expanded to include downstream effects of ATR activation, such as phosphorylation of CHEK1 (CHK1) and cell cycle arrest. This would provide a more complete picture of the G1 DNA damage checkpoint pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Comprehensive Process Coverage**: Consider expanding the model to show how other proteins like ATRIP and RPA are involved in the ATR activation process alongside the 9-1-1 complex and TOPBP1.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Visual Organization**: While not a scientific issue, the layout of the activities could be reorganized to better reflect the temporal and spatial relationships between the components.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the model [gomodel:65039e8700000055](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:65039e8700000055) is scientifically accurate and follows the GO-CAM curation guidelines. It correctly represents how phosphorylation mediates interactions between TP53BP1, TOPBP1, and the 9-1-1 complex (via RAD9A) in controlling the G1 DNA damage checkpoint. \n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the key molecular functions, causal relationships, and biological contexts of this pathway. With some minor enhancements as suggested above, this model could provide an even more comprehensive representation of the G1 DNA damage checkpoint pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary literature references used in the model, particularly PMID:27153538, PMID:31135337, and PMID:20545769, provide strong evidence for the interactions and relationships depicted in the model.\n",

      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is well-constructed, I've identified a few areas for potential improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: The RPA complex is represented using GO:0005662 \"DNA replication factor A complex\" as the enabling entity for damaged DNA binding, which is appropriate according to GO-CAM guidelines when the specific subunit carrying the activity is not known. However, the model also shows RPA1 (UniProtKB:P27694) having a separate chromatin-protein adaptor activity. Given the UniProt record for RPA1 indicates it's responsible for single-stranded DNA binding in the complex, it might be worth considering whether to consolidate these activities or clarify their distinctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Complex Members**: The DNA replication factor A complex (GO:0005662) is shown without its member proteins. According to GO-CAM guidelines for complex annotation, the members should be specified when known, especially since they are well-characterized (RPA1, RPA2, RPA3).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Temporal Context**: The model would benefit from clarifying that these events occur during S-phase of the cell cycle, as mentioned in the research paper. The phosphorylation of HTATSF1 by CK2 is S-phase specific.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular Details**: While the model captures the key causal relationships, some specific molecular details from the paper could be included, such as the specific lysine residues being targeted for PARylation on RPA1 or the specific mechanism by which TOPBP1 promotes RAD51 loading.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately captures the biological process described in the primary literature. The activities and their causal relationships are appropriately represented, and the evidence is properly cited. With the minor improvements suggested above, particularly regarding the representation of the RPA complex members, this model will serve as an excellent representation of how HTATSF1 and TOPBP1 promote RPA-RAD51 exchange in homologous recombination repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model aligns well with the current understanding of DNA repair mechanisms and follows GO-CAM annotation guidelines. It provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms of homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "**Title**: TRIM69 activation of STK3 by ubiquitination leading to centrosome separation (Human)  \n",
      "**ID**: [gomodel:65039e8700001110](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:65039e8700001110)  \n",
      "**Taxon**: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)  \n",
      "**Status**: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents a newly identified signaling pathway in which the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM69 regulates STK3 (also known as MST2) by ubiquitination, which in turn activates PLK1 and ultimately NEK2, leading to centrosome separation in mitotic cells. This pathway is important for proper chromosome segregation during cell division.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Factual Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is based on recent research published by Wang et al. in 2023 (PMID:37739411), which identified the \"TRIM69-MST2 signaling axis\" that regulates centrosome dynamics and chromosome segregation. The paper provides strong experimental evidence supporting the pathway described in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key points from the literature that are correctly captured in the model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TRIM69 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates STK3/MST2 (not for degradation but for relocalization to the perinuclear cytoskeleton)\n",
      "2. This promotes STK3 association with PLK1, leading to STK3 phosphorylation at S15\n",
      "3. Activated STK3 then phosphorylates NEK2, which in turn phosphorylates centrosomal proteins like C-NAP1 and CROCC to promote centrosome separation\n",
      "4. This pathway is important for proper mitotic progression and centrosome dynamics\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Connections\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the causal flow through this pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TRIM69 (E3 ubiquitin ligase activity) → provides input for → PLK1 (protein serine kinase activity)\n",
      "2. PLK1 (protein serine kinase activity) → directly positively regulates → STK3 (protein serine/threonine kinase activity)\n",
      "3. STK3 (protein serine/threonine kinase activity) → directly positively regulates → NEK2 (protein kinase activity)\n",
      "\n",
      "All four proteins are correctly annotated with their appropriate molecular functions and localized to the centrosome (GO:0005813), which is supported by the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological processes are also correctly annotated:\n",
      "- TRIM69 and STK3 are part of \"protein localization to centrosome\" (GO:0071539)\n",
      "- PLK1 is part of \"centrosome cycle\" (GO:0007098)\n",
      "- NEK2 is part of \"centrosome separation\" (GO:0051299)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) for most activities and connections\n",
      "- ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence used in manual assertion) for PLK1's role in centrosome cycle\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary literature source cited (PMID:37739411) directly supports the relationships in the model. Additional supporting references are used for specific activities of PLK1, STK3, and NEK2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Molecular Details**: The model could be enhanced by including information about the specific ubiquitination sites on STK3 (K279 is mentioned in the paper as one site) and the phosphorylation sites (S15, S316, T336, T384, S385 are mentioned in the paper).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Downstream Targets**: The model stops at NEK2's kinase activity, but could be extended to include NEK2's known phosphorylation targets at the centrosome (C-NAP1/CEP250 and CROCC/rootletin), which are directly responsible for centrosome cohesion dissolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Compartment Refinement**: While all activities are correctly localized to the centrosome, the paper specifies that TRIM69 redistributes STK3 to the \"perinuclear cytoskeleton\", which could be a more precise cellular compartment annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **PRC1 and Dynein Roles**: The paper also describes roles for PRC1 and Dynein in TRIM69-mediated centrosome clustering, which could be included as additional components of this pathway, especially since this function is distinct from the STK3-mediated centrosome disjunction pathway currently modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows the GO-CAM best practices for representing regulatory pathways:\n",
      "- The \"provides input for\" relation (RO:0002413) is correctly used when TRIM69 acts on PLK1\n",
      "- The \"directly positively regulates\" relation (RO:0002629) is used appropriately to connect kinase activities that directly activate the downstream protein\n",
      "- Each activity is properly contextualized with cellular compartment and biological process\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of molecular function terms is appropriate, with each protein enabled by its known catalytic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents a recently discovered signaling pathway involving TRIM69, STK3/MST2, PLK1, and NEK2 in centrosome dynamics. It is based on sound experimental evidence and follows the GO-CAM guidelines for representing causal molecular mechanisms. The model could be enhanced by adding more molecular details about ubiquitination and phosphorylation sites, and by extending the pathway to include more downstream components.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model provides a valuable resource for understanding centrosome biology and mitotic regulation, which is particularly relevant to cancer research since centrosome abnormalities are frequently observed in many cancer types, and components of this pathway (especially PLK1 and NEK2) are often dysregulated in cancer.\n",

      "## Overview\n",
      "This model represents the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated signaling pathway in mouse. It includes a sequential series of activities starting with TNF cytokine activity, leading through TNF receptor signaling, adapter proteins, and culminating in sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Structure and Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains six activities with the following key genes/proteins:\n",
      "1. TNF (MGI:MGI:104798) - cytokine activity\n",
      "2. TNFRSF1A (MGI:MGI:1314884) - tumor necrosis factor receptor activity\n",
      "3. NSMAF (MGI:MGI:1341864) - signaling adaptor activity\n",
      "4. RACK1 (MGI:MGI:101849) - signaling adaptor activity\n",
      "5. EED (MGI:MGI:95286) - enzyme activator activity\n",
      "6. SMPD2 (MGI:MGI:1278330) - sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow is: TNF → TNFRSF1A → NSMAF → RACK1 → EED → SMPD2, with all regulatory relationships being \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate pathway representation**: The model correctly represents the TNF signaling pathway leading to neutral sphingomyelinase activation, which is supported by the literature (PMIDs 14985352, 12391233, 9520418).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct molecular function annotations**: The molecular functions are appropriately assigned, such as cytokine activity for TNF and receptor activity for TNFRSF1A.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper cellular context**: Activities are correctly localized, with TNF in extracellular space (GO:0005615) and the receptor/signaling components at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistent causal relationships**: The use of \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) is appropriate for the signaling cascade represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence support**: Each activity and relationship is supported by experimental evidence, primarily from the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues/Concerns\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing supporting annotation for causal relationship**: The causal association between NSMAF (gomodel:6516135700000211/6516135700000222) and RACK1 (gomodel:6516135700000211/6516135700000221) lacks evidence annotations, which should be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Activity annotation considerations**: Based on the PMID:9520418 paper, SMPD2 (neutral sphingomyelinase) is an important enzyme in sphingolipid signaling. While the model correctly represents its activity, the literature suggests that TNF only moderately increases ceramide production through this pathway, which is consistent with the model but could be mentioned in annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological process annotation**: All activities except SMPD2 are annotated as part of \"tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway\" (GO:0033209), while SMPD2 is annotated to \"ceramide metabolic process\" (GO:0006672). It might be worth considering whether SMPD2 should also be linked to the TNF signaling pathway, since it appears to be the endpoint of this particular signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex considerations**: According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, if specific subunits carrying activities are known, they should be represented individually. This model correctly follows this approach by representing individual proteins rather than complexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model follows the signaling receptor annotation guidelines appropriately by having:\n",
      "   - The cytokine (TNF) with cytokine activity in extracellular space\n",
      "   - The receptor (TNFRSF1A) with receptor activity at the plasma membrane\n",
      "   - The correct causal relationships between the components\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The model is parsimonious and represents a clear flow of activities without unnecessary complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. All annotations are supported by experimental evidence, mostly using ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) and ECO:0000266 (sequence orthology evidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add missing evidence**: Provide evidence annotations for the causal association between NSMAF and RACK1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider biological process annotation for SMPD2**: Evaluate whether SMPD2 should also be annotated to the TNF signaling pathway in addition to ceramide metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Review literature completeness**: Based on PMID:9520418, the model accurately represents the pathway, but annotations could reflect that the effect of TNF on SMPD2 activation is moderate rather than strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the TNF signaling pathway leading to neutral sphingomyelinase activation in mouse.

      "\n",
      "### Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the heme B biosynthetic process in mouse (Mus musculus), showing the complete pathway from initial substrates to the final heme B product. The model includes 9 activities carried out by different enzymes, with appropriate causal connections between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete Pathway Representation**: The model captures the entire heme B biosynthesis pathway from the initial synthesis of 5-aminolevulinate through to the formation of ferroheme b.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Detailed Molecular Context**: Each activity correctly specifies:\n",
      "   - The molecular function (MF) of the enzyme\n",
      "   - The biological process (BP) it's part of (heme B biosynthetic process)\n",
      "   - The cellular component (CC) where it occurs\n",
      "   - Input and output molecules with proper CHEBI identifiers\n",
      "   - Appropriate evidence with PMID references\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Connections**: The model uses the \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) predicate appropriately to connect activities in a sequential manner that reflects the biological flow of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Localization**: The model correctly represents the subcellular locations where each step occurs (cytosol, mitochondrial matrix, mitochondrial intermembrane space, mitochondrial membrane).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Species Specificity**: The model is properly specified for mouse, using MGI IDs for gene products.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Evidence Support**: Each activity is well-supported by multiple evidence codes (ECO terms) and literature references (PMIDs).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Specific Aspects to Note\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Transporter Activity**: The model includes a heme B transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0170003) enabled by PR:B2RXV4-2 (mFLVCR1/isom2 Mmus) that occurs in the mitochondrial membrane, which follows the proper pattern for annotating transporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Input/Output Annotation**: The model properly uses the has_input and has_output relations to show the substrates and products of each enzymatic reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subcellular Compartments**: The model accurately represents the compartmentalization of the pathway across mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments, which is crucial for heme biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Transport Steps**: While the model includes the final heme B transport step, it could potentially benefit from explicitly modeling the transport of intermediates between cellular compartments, if supported by evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Representation**: If any of these enzymes function as part of complexes, that information could be represented according to the complex annotation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulatory Processes**: The model focuses on the core enzymatic steps but doesn't include regulatory aspects of heme biosynthesis. Adding these if evidence exists would enhance the model's comprehensiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the canonical heme B biosynthetic pathway as described in biochemistry textbooks and the scientific literature. The sequence of reactions, enzyme activities, substrates/products, and cellular locations align with current knowledge of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Assessment\n",

      "# Review of GO-CAM model: 65288b2200000194\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This model represents the role of STING1 (Stimulator of Interferon Genes protein) as a proton channel that promotes autophagosome assembly in humans. The model connects several key proteins involved in the autophagy pathway, including ATG4B, ATG4C, ATG4D, ATG5, and MAP1LC3B.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "1. **Scientific Accuracy**: The model accurately represents recent findings about STING1's function as a proton channel, specifically based on the 2023 publication (PMID:37535724) that identified this function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular Functions**: Appropriate molecular functions are assigned to each protein:\n",
      "   - STING1 is correctly annotated with proton channel activity (GO:0015252)\n",
      "   - ATG4 proteins (ATG4B, ATG4C, ATG4D) are annotated with appropriate protease activities\n",
      "   - ATG5 is annotated with ATG8-family ligase activity\n",
      "   - MAP1LC3B is annotated with phosphatidylethanolamine binding\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Localization**: Cellular components are appropriately assigned:\n",
      "   - STING1 is correctly localized to the Golgi membrane (GO:0000139)\n",
      "   - ATG4B is correctly localized to autophagosome membrane (GO:0000421)\n",
      "   - MAP1LC3B is correctly localized to the autophagosome membrane\n",
      "   - ATG5 is correctly localized to the autophagosome\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological Process**: All activities are appropriately part of the autophagosome assembly (GO:0000045) process.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Causal Relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationships to link activities:\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) is used to connect the protease activities to MAP1LC3B activity\n",
      "   - RO:0002407 (is upstream of) connects STING1's proton channel activity to ATG5's ligase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "1. **Evidence Completeness**: Several causal associations lack evidence annotations. For example, there's an unannotated causal association between ATG4C and MAP1LC3B.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Contextual Information**: The model doesn't completely capture the mechanism by which STING1's proton channel activity promotes autophagosome formation. The specific pH changes in the Golgi and their consequences on autophagy machinery could be more explicitly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Connection Clarity**: The connection between ATG5 and MAP1LC3B activity could be more detailed to represent the complete LC3 lipidation process, which involves additional proteins like ATG7 and ATG3 that are not included in this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "1. **Complex Annotation**: The model follows GO-CAM guidelines for protein annotation, focusing on individual proteins rather than complexes when the specific subunits carrying activities are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Relationships**: The model correctly uses the appropriate relationship predicates for connecting activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Annotation**: Most activities and relationships include proper evidence codes and literature references, though some causal associations lack evidence annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "The model accurately represents current scientific understanding of STING1's role in autophagy based on recent literature. The 2023 paper (PMID:37535724) identified STING1 as a proton channel that facilitates autophagosome formation by promoting proton efflux from the Golgi, which is captured in this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The connection between ATG4 family proteins (ATG4B, ATG4C, ATG4D) cleaving the C-terminus of MAP1LC3B to expose the glycine residue needed for lipidation is biologically accurate. Similarly, ATG5's role in the lipidation process and MAP1LC3B's association with autophagosome membranes are correctly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "1. Add evidence codes to all causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider expanding the model to include additional proteins in the autophagy pathway, such as ATG7 and ATG3, to provide a more complete representation of the LC3 lipidation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Add additional annotations to clarify the mechanism by which STING1's proton channel activity influences autophagosome formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:65288b2200000194) provides an accurate representation of STING1's role as a proton channel in promoting autophagosome assembly, consistent with current scientific literature. The model successfully captures the key proteins and their activities in this process, with appropriate molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships. With minor improvements in evidence annotation and additional contextual details, this model would be an excellent reference for the field.\n",

      "## Evaluation and Comments\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate Biological Process Representation**: The model correctly represents the biological regulation of cGAS activity through palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, based on the recent literature (PMID:37802025).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct Use of Causal Relations**: The model uses appropriate causal relations (directly positively regulates, directly negatively regulates) to show how the activities influence each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper Cellular Component Annotations**: The activities are correctly annotated with their cellular components (cytosol).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence Strength**: All associations are supported by experimental evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence) and cited with appropriate PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complete Pathway Representation**: The model captures the complete pathway from palmitoylation to depalmitoylation and shows how these modifications affect cGAS function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Molecular Details**: The model does not explicitly include which specific residues of cGAS (Cys-404 and Cys-405) are palmitoylated by ZDHHC9 and depalmitoylated by LYPLAL1. This information is available in the literature (PMID:37802025) and could potentially be added as annotations to enrich the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Activity Chain Completeness**: The model correctly shows that CGAS DNA binding leads to molecular condensate scaffold activity and then to cGMP-AMP synthase activity, which aligns with our understanding that DNA binding leads to phase separation and activation of enzymatic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream Effects**: While the model focuses on the regulation of cGAS activity, it could be extended to include downstream effects in the cGAS/STING pathway, such as the activation of STING by cGAMP and subsequent type I interferon production.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:65288b2200000496](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:65288b2200000496) is a well-constructed representation of the regulation of cGAS activity via palmitoylation and depalmitoylation by ZDHHC9 and LYPLAL1, respectively. It accurately captures the key molecular activities and their causal relationships as described in recent literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows the GO-CAM curation guidelines and best practices for representing regulatory processes and enzyme activities. The causal flow from palmitoylation to DNA binding, molecular condensate formation, and enzymatic activity is logically structured and biologically sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could potentially be enhanced by adding specific details about the residues involved in palmitoylation/depalmitoylation and by extending it to include downstream effects of cGAS activation, but these are not necessary for the core representation of the regulatory process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality GO-CAM model that effectively captures current knowledge about the regulation of cGAS activity through post-translational modifications.\n",

      "## Quality Control Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Model Quality\n",

      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Incorporates recent scientific findings about the role of STEEP1 and TAK1 in STING trafficking\n",

      "\n",
      "### Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",

      "2. **Include additional relevant PTMs**: While the phosphorylation of STING by TAK1 is represented, other important post-translational modifications like palmitoylation at Cys-91 could be included, as this is known to be critical for STING activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Represent STING dimerization/oligomerization**: The model could explicitly represent STING's dimerization and oligomerization, which are important for its activation and trafficking.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Include the role of VPS34 complex I**: Recent research shows that STEEP1 recruits the VPS34 complex I to produce PI3P at the ER, which promotes membrane curvature and STING trafficking. This aspect could be included for completeness.\n",

      "This model (gomodel:65288b2200001166) represents the molecular mechanisms by which TRIM55 and TRIM21 regulate the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway through ubiquitination of NFKB2 (p100/p52) in human cells. The model captures how TRIM55 facilitates TRIM21-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of VCP, which in turn promotes K48-linked ubiquitin-dependent degradation of NFKB2, ultimately inhibiting its DNA-binding transcription activator activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes five key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TRIM55's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (GO:0061630) targeting VCP for K48-linked ubiquitination\n",
      "2. TRIM55's protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674)\n",

      "5. NFKB2's DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific (GO:0001228)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Correct aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper evidence and citations**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes and citations, with most activities citing PMID:37816088 using ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The causal relationships between activities use the proper relation types:\n",
      "   - TRIM55's adaptor activity provides input for (RO:0002413) TRIM21's ligase activity\n",
      "   - TRIM55's ligase activity provides input for (RO:0002413) VCP's binding activity\n",
      "   - TRIM21's ligase activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) VCP's binding activity\n",
      "   - VCP's binding activity directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) NFKB2's transcription activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate biological process annotations**: Each activity is associated with relevant biological processes:\n",
      "   - TRIM55's ubiquitin ligase activity is part of protein K48-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070936)\n",
      "   - TRIM55's adaptor activity is part of positive regulation of non-canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:1901224)\n",
      "   - TRIM21's ligase activity is part of protein K63-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070534)\n",
      "   - VCP's binding activity is part of positive regulation of non-canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:1901224)\n",
      "   - NFKB2's activity is part of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0007249)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Correct subcellular locations**: Activities are appropriately localized:\n",
      "   - TRIM55 and TRIM21 are in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - NFKB2 is in the nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "   - VCP is in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Discrepancies and Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clarification of NF-κB pathway**: The model associates NFKB2's transcription activity with canonical NF-κB signaling (GO:0007249), but according to the PMID:37816088 paper, TRIM55 specifically regulates the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. This association should be updated to non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **VCP's role clarification**: While the model accurately represents VCP's activity based on the cited publication, it could be clearer about the specific mechanism by which VCP promotes NFKB2 processing. According to the paper, VCP, upon K63-linked ubiquitination by TRIM21, helps in extracting and processing p100 (NFKB2) to generate p52.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing molecular details**: The model doesn't explicitly capture the formation of the VCP-UFD1-NPL4 complex, which according to the paper is crucial for p100 processing. Considering adding this complex or noting its role.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Incomplete representation of the pathway**: The model focuses on the inhibitory aspect of NFKB2 regulation, but doesn't fully capture that this processing is actually part of the activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway (as p52 generation is a necessary step).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Biological process associations**: While the current biological process associations are generally appropriate, consider adding more specific terms related to B-cell immune responses or germinal center formation, which are highlighted as downstream consequences in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the GO-CAM guidelines for E3 ubiquitin ligases:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **E3 ligase activity annotation**: The model correctly represents TRIM55 and TRIM21 with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) and appropriate biological processes describing the type of ubiquitination (K48-linked and K63-linked, respectively).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex annotation**: The model correctly represents the individual activities rather than using a complex term, which is appropriate since the specific activities of each protein are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**: The model properly uses the \"provides input for\" and \"directly regulates\" (positively or negatively) relationships between activities as specified in the guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the molecular mechanisms described in the primary literature. It follows most GO-CAM best practices for representing E3 ubiquitin ligases and their regulatory networks. The few suggested improvements would make the model even more precisely aligned with the biological mechanisms described in the source paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be enhanced by:\n",
      "1. Correcting the pathway association for NFKB2 from canonical to non-canonical NF-κB signaling\n",
      "2. Possibly adding the VCP-UFD1-NPL4 complex formation\n",
      "3. Clarifying the dual role of p100 processing as both inhibition of full-length NFKB2 and activation of p52-mediated signaling\n",
      "4. Adding more specific downstream biological processes related to B-cell function\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these minor suggestions, the model is generally accurate, well-evidenced, and properly represents the molecular mechanisms described in the literature.\n",

      "\n",
      "# GO-CAM Review: USP9X-TRIM32 modulation of IQCB1 during G1-S (Human)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary of the Model\n",
      "This GO-CAM models the molecular interactions between three key proteins involved in ciliogenesis regulation:\n",
      "1. **IQCB1/NPHP5** (Q15051) - a centrosomal protein that regulates ciliogenesis \n",
      "2. **USP9X** (Q93008) - a deubiquitinating enzyme\n",
      "3. **TRIM32** (Q13049) - an E3 ubiquitin ligase\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows how USP9X and TRIM32 regulate IQCB1 during the G1-S phase of the cell cycle through different types of ubiquitination, which controls cilium assembly. This is supported primarily by evidence from PMID:28498859.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Content Evaluation\n",
      "The model is biologically accurate and aligns well with the literature evidence. The central paper (PMID:28498859) describes how:\n",
      "- USP9X deubiquitinates NPHP5/IQCB1, protecting it from degradation during G0/G1/S phase\n",
      "- TRIM32 (BBS11) negatively regulates ciliogenesis by K63-linked ubiquitination of IQCB1, leading to its delocalization\n",
      "- These mechanisms are part of controlling cilia assembly/disassembly through the cell cycle\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM correctly represents these interactions where:\n",
      "- USP9X's deubiquitinating activity (GO:0101005) directly positively regulates IQCB1's BBSome binding (GO:0062063)\n",
      "- TRIM32's E3 ligase activity (GO:0061630) directly negatively regulates IQCB1's BBSome binding\n",
      "- IQCB1 functions as a protein-macromolecule adaptor (GO:0030674) providing input for USP9X's activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Function and Causal Relationship Evaluation\n",
      "The MF and causal relationship annotations are appropriate:\n",
      "1. USP9X's deubiquitinase activity (GO:0101005) → **directly positively regulates** (RO:0002629) → IQCB1's BBSome binding (GO:0062063)\n",
      "2. TRIM32's ubiquitin ligase activity (GO:0061630) → **directly negatively regulates** (RO:0002630) → IQCB1's BBSome binding (GO:0062063)\n",
      "3. IQCB1's adaptor activity (GO:0030674) → **provides input for** (RO:0002413) → USP9X's activity (GO:0101005)\n",
      "\n",
      "These connections are well-supported by the evidence presented and use the correct relation predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Spatial Localization Evaluation\n",
      "The cellular locations are accurately represented:\n",
      "- All three proteins are correctly localized to the centrosome (GO:0005813)\n",
      "- This is substantiated by the experimental evidence provided\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Process Context Evaluation\n",
      "The model correctly places these activities in the biological process context:\n",
      "- USP9X's and IQCB1's activities are part of cytosolic ciliogenesis (GO:0061824)\n",
      "- TRIM32's activity is part of negative regulation of cilium assembly (GO:1902018)\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of these processes are accurately supported by the literature evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Issues and Improvement Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I identified a few potential improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional process contexts**: The model could benefit from adding the cell cycle context (G1-S transition) mentioned in the title. The literature clearly describes how these interactions vary through the cell cycle, with USP9X protecting IQCB1 during G0/G1/S, and TRIM32 regulating it during G2/M.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex representation**: According to the GO-CAM complex annotation guidelines, if the subunit carrying an activity is known (as in this case), we should represent each protein individually rather than using a complex ID. The model correctly follows this guideline.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing components**: The literature mentions MARCH7 as another E3 ligase interacting with IQCB1, adding K48-linked ubiquitination leading to degradation. This component could potentially be added for completeness, although the current focus on TRIM32 is valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Temporal dynamics**: The model could better capture how ubiquitination and deubiquitination change through the cell cycle. The paper describes how USP9X dissociates from the centrosome in G2/M phase, which enables TRIM32 to K63-ubiquitinate IQCB1, triggering delocalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a clear and accurate representation of how USP9X and TRIM32 regulate IQCB1 in cilia formation. The model effectively:\n",
      "- Uses appropriate molecular functions for each protein\n",
      "- Correctly applies causal relationship predicates\n",
      "- Places activities in the proper cellular locations\n",
      "- Assigns activities to the correct biological processes\n",
      "\n",
      "The modular nature of the model makes it easy to understand the regulatory relationships between these proteins, and the evidence provided substantiates all the assertions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully captures a critical mechanism for regulating ciliogenesis, which has implications for understanding ciliopathies like Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Senior-Loken syndrome associated with mutations in TRIM32 and IQCB1, respectively.\n",

      "## Model Title\n",
      "\"USP9X-TRIM32 modulation of IQCB1 during G2-M (Human)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This model describes a molecular pathway involving USP9X (deubiquitinating enzyme), TRIM32 and MARCH7 (E3 ubiquitin ligases), and IQCB1/NPHP5 (a protein with adaptor activity). The model shows how these proteins interact during cilium assembly regulation within the centrosome.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four key activities:\n",
      "1. TRIM32 (Q13049) - ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "2. IQCB1 (Q15051) - protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674)\n",
      "3. MARCHF7/MARCH7 (Q9H992) - ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "4. USP9X (Q93008) - molecular sequestering activity (GO:0140313)\n",
      "\n",
      "These activities are connected through causal relationships:\n",
      "- TRIM32 activity directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) IQCB1 activity\n",
      "- MARCH7 activity directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) IQCB1 activity\n",
      "- USP9X activity directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) MARCH7 activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows the biological processes involved:\n",
      "- TRIM32 and MARCH7 are part of negative regulation of cilium assembly (GO:1902018)\n",
      "- IQCB1 and USP9X are part of cilium assembly (GO:0060271)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cellular locations:\n",
      "- TRIM32, MARCH7, and IQCB1 occur in the centrosome (GO:0005813)\n",
      "- USP9X occurs in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the literature:\n",
      "1. The model correctly represents that IQCB1/NPHP5 is a positive regulator of ciliogenesis (cilium assembly), as confirmed by PMID 28498859.\n",
      "2. IQCB1 directly binds to USP9X (a deubiquitinating enzyme) and two E3 ubiquitin ligases (TRIM32 and MARCH7), which is consistent with the literature.\n",
      "3. The model correctly captures that IQCB1 undergoes ubiquitination by TRIM32 and MARCH7, which negatively regulates its function in cilium assembly.\n",
      "4. USP9X counteracts the ubiquitination of NPHP5/IQCB1 to regulate ciliogenesis, as shown in PMID 28498859.\n",
      "5. The location of these activities in the centrosome is supported by the literature, as IQCB1 is localized to the ciliary transition zone and centrosome.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Function Representation**:\n",
      "   - Each protein has a correctly assigned molecular function term\n",
      "   - TRIM32 and MARCH7 have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "   - IQCB1 is assigned protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674), which is appropriate\n",
      "   - USP9X is assigned molecular sequestering activity (GO:0140313) - this is a bit unusual but appears to be attempting to represent its role in counteracting ubiquitination\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Relationships**:\n",
      "   - The model uses \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630) consistently and appropriately to indicate the direct negative regulatory relationships between proteins\n",
      "   - This follows the guidelines for representing regulation in GO-CAM\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological Process Context**:\n",
      "   - Each molecular function is appropriately placed within a biological process context\n",
      "   - The processes (negative regulation of cilium assembly and cilium assembly) accurately capture the roles of these proteins\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Component Context**:\n",
      "   - Each activity has an appropriate cellular location\n",
      "   - The centrosome location for TRIM32, MARCH7, and IQCB1 is accurate\n",
      "   - USP9X in cytoplasm is also accurate, though it should be noted that USP9X also localizes to centrosomes according to literature\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **USP9X molecular function**:\n",
      "   - The use of \"molecular sequestering activity\" (GO:0140313) for USP9X is somewhat unconventional\n",
      "   - USP9X is primarily a deubiquitinating enzyme, so \"deubiquitinase activity\" (GO:0101005) or \"ubiquitin-specific protease activity\" would be more appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The model captures the core regulatory interactions but could be expanded to include more details on how this regulation affects downstream cilium assembly processes\n",
      "   - The connection to G2-M phase mentioned in the title could be made more explicit in the model\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence**:\n",
      "   - All activities have evidence from publications, which is good practice\n",
      "   - However, it would be helpful to include more specific evidence for each causal relationship\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal flow clarity**:\n",
      "   - The causal flow from USP9X to MARCH7 to IQCB1 could be made clearer by possibly showing how USP9X might also directly affect IQCB1\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the biological interactions between USP9X, TRIM32, MARCH7, and IQCB1 in regulating cilium assembly. The model is consistent with the scientific literature and generally follows GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively captures the antagonistic relationship between E3 ubiquitin ligases (TRIM32 and MARCH7) and the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X in regulating IQCB1's role in cilium assembly. The use of appropriate molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components creates a coherent and biologically meaningful representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main recommendation would be to reconsider the molecular function assigned to USP9X to better reflect its deubiquitinating enzymatic activity rather than using the more general \"molecular sequestering activity\" term.\n",

      "## Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is supported by evidence from the paper PMID:32895492, which identifies BRD3 and DIGIT form phase-separated condensates to regulate endoderm differentiation. The EP300 histone acetyltransferase activity is supported by evidence from PMID:21131905.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the findings from the primary literature (PMID:32895492) regarding the phase-separated condensate formation by BRD3 and DIGIT\n",
      "2. The causal relationships between molecules are correctly represented using appropriate relationship predicates\n",
      "3. The model includes appropriate cellular contexts for the molecular activities\n",
      "4. All activities are properly linked to the biological process of endodermal cell differentiation\n",
      "5. The model includes appropriate evidence citations\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing detailed mechanistic connections**: The model could be enhanced by including more details about how the BRD3-DIGIT condensates specifically regulate endoderm differentiation genes. The literature indicates BRD3 occupies enhancers of endoderm transcription factors, but these genes and their specific regulation are not included in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing complex information**: According to the publication, BRD3 and DIGIT form phase-separated condensates, which could be modeled using a complex representation. According to the document on [how to annotate complexes in GO-CAM](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:653b0ce600000202), if the activity is shared by several proteins, these should be properly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing detailed activities of EP300**: While the model correctly shows EP300's role in H3K18 acetylation, it could further detail how EP300 is recruited to specific genomic loci during endoderm differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing activity regulation details**: The model could be improved by representing how the BRD3-DIGIT condensates' formation is regulated or affected by cellular conditions during endoderm differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the core molecular mechanisms by which BRD3 and DIGIT interact to form phase-separated condensates that regulate endoderm differentiation. The model correctly uses appropriate GO terms and relationship predicates to represent the activities and their causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary literature strongly supports the model's representation of BRD3 and DIGIT forming phase-separated condensates to regulate endoderm differentiation. The model could be enhanced by including more detailed downstream effects on specific genes and transcription factors involved in endoderm differentiation, as indicated by the research paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities and their causal relationships. Some additional molecular details could further enrich the model but would not change its core accurate representation of the biological process.\n",

      "### Model Summary:\n",
      "This model represents how TAX1BP1 mediates the degradation of MAVS (Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein) by the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH in human cells. The model involves four key proteins and their respective activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. MAVS ([UniProtKB:Q7Z434](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q7Z434)) - signaling adaptor activity\n",

      "\n",
      "### Evaluation of Model Accuracy and Completeness:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Biological Content:\n",
      "The model correctly captures the biological relationship described in the literature where TAX1BP1 acts as an adaptor to facilitate ITCH-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of MAVS. This is supported by the evidence cited in the model, particularly PMID:27736772, which describes TAX1BP1's role in restraining virus-induced apoptosis by facilitating ITCH-mediated degradation of MAVS.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Molecular Functions and Locations:\n",
      "- MAVS is correctly annotated with \"signaling adaptor activity\" (GO:0035591) and located in the mitochondrion (GO:0005739), which aligns with its known function and localization.\n",
      "- TAX1BP1 is properly annotated with \"protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\" (GO:0030674) and also located in the mitochondrion, which is consistent with its role in facilitating ITCH-mediated degradation of MAVS.\n",
      "- ITCH is annotated with \"ubiquitin protein ligase activity\" (GO:0061630) and located in the mitochondrion, which accurately represents its role in ubiquitinating MAVS.\n",
      "- TRAF3IP3 is annotated with \"molecular adaptor activity\" (GO:0060090) and located in the mitochondrion, which is consistent with its role in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Causal Relationships:\n",
      "The model correctly uses the following causal relations:\n",
      "- TAX1BP1's adaptor activity \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) ITCH's ubiquitin ligase activity, which is appropriate for an adaptor that brings together an enzyme and its substrate.\n",
      "- ITCH's ubiquitin ligase activity \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630) MAVS's signaling adaptor activity, which correctly represents ITCH-mediated degradation of MAVS.\n",
      "- MAVS's signaling adaptor activity \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) TRAF3IP3's molecular adaptor activity, which accurately reflects MAVS's role in activating downstream signaling components.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Process Annotations:\n",
      "- MAVS and TRAF3IP3 are both annotated as part of \"cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0002753), which is accurate.\n",
      "- TAX1BP1 is annotated as part of \"negative regulation of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0039532), which correctly represents its role in downregulating MAVS-mediated signaling.\n",
      "- ITCH is annotated as part of \"protein K48-linked ubiquitination\" (GO:0070936), which is the appropriate process for its role in targeting MAVS for degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Adaptors Annotation**: The model correctly follows the guidelines for annotating molecular adaptors. Both TAX1BP1 and TRAF3IP3 are annotated with appropriate adaptor molecular functions, and the \"provides input for\" relation is correctly used for TAX1BP1's role in facilitating ITCH's activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Representation**: The model doesn't explicitly represent any protein complexes but correctly represents the individual proteins and their respective activities, which is appropriate given that specific protein-protein interactions rather than stable complexes are being modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence**: Each activity and causal relationship is supported by appropriate evidence codes and PMID references, which is in line with GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological Pathway Representation**: The model represents a cohesive biological pathway with clear directionality from MAVS to TRAF3IP3, with regulatory inputs from TAX1BP1 and ITCH, making it easy to understand the overall process.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consider Additional Context**: The model could be enhanced by including more context about what triggers this pathway, such as viral infection, which could be represented as an upstream cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Detailed Process Outcomes**: The model currently doesn't explicitly show the outcome of MAVS degradation for cellular processes. Adding downstream effects, such as reduced interferon production or inhibition of apoptosis, would provide a more complete picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider Adding TRAF3**: The model mentions TRAF3IP3 but doesn't include TRAF3 itself, which might be relevant given TRAF3's important role in MAVS signaling as indicated by the UniProt entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the TAX1BP1-mediated degradation of MAVS by the E3 ligase ITCH in human cells. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular adaptors and signaling pathways. The causal relationships between the activities are appropriately represented with clear directionality. The model includes appropriate evidence for all assertions and correctly represents the subcellular localizations of the proteins involved. Minor enhancements could be made to provide more context and downstream effects, but overall this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that effectively captures the biological process it aims to represent.\n",

      "## Overview of the Model\n",
      "This model represents a signaling pathway involving the TLR4 receptor, adaptors TICAM2 and TICAM1 (TRIF), the negative regulator complex of TRIM32-TAX1BP1, and the DNA-binding transcription factor activity of IRF3. The model describes a mechanism for negatively regulating TLR3/4-mediated immune responses by targeting TICAM1 for selective autophagic degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures a key regulatory mechanism in TLR3/4 signaling as described in the literature, particularly in the paper by Yang et al. (2017, PMID:28898289). The model accurately represents:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TLR4 receptor activity recruiting TICAM2\n",
      "2. TICAM2 acting as a molecular adaptor that directly positively regulates TICAM1\n",
      "3. TICAM1 molecular adaptor activity \n",
      "4. TAX1BP1 protein-macromolecule adaptor activity targeting TICAM1 for autophagic degradation\n",
      "5. TRIM32 protein-macromolecule adaptor activity providing input for TAX1BP1\n",
      "6. IRF3 DNA-binding transcription factor activity as a downstream effector\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Connections Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal connections in the model are appropriate and consistent with the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TLR4 signaling receptor activity → directly positively regulates → TICAM2 molecular adaptor activity  \n",
      "2. TICAM2 molecular adaptor activity → directly positively regulates → TICAM1 molecular adaptor activity\n",
      "3. TRIM32 protein-macromolecule adaptor activity → provides input for → TAX1BP1 protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\n",
      "4. TAX1BP1 protein-macromolecule adaptor activity → regulates autophagosome assembly → TICAM1 molecular adaptor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "These causal connections accurately reflect the mechanism described in the literature, where TRIM32 acts as a bridge protein that connects TICAM1 to TAX1BP1, leading to selective autophagic degradation of TICAM1 and termination of TLR3/4 signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practice Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model largely follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Adaptor Annotation**: The model correctly uses GO:0060090 (molecular adaptor activity) for TICAM2 and TICAM1, and GO:0030674 (protein-macromolecule adaptor activity) for TAX1BP1 and TRIM32, consistent with the \"How to annotate molecular adaptors\" guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Relations**: The use of \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) and \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) is appropriate for the adaptor relationships described.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Contextual Information**: Each activity is properly annotated with cellular location (occurs_in) and biological process (part_of).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence Documentation**: Evidence codes and PMIDs are properly included for almost all assertions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I have a few suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Missing Evidence**: The causal association between TICAM2 and TICAM1 lacks evidence (evidence field is empty). This should be supported with an appropriate PMID, likely PMID:18222170 which is used elsewhere in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider Additional Activities**: The model could potentially be enriched by including:\n",
      "   - The downstream signaling components after TICAM1, such as TBK1 and its kinase activity\n",
      "   - The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM32, although the paper indicates this function is E3-independent in this specific pathway\n",
      "   - LC3 (MAP1LC3A is listed in the objects but not included in the model activities)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clarify Mechanism**: The relationship between TAX1BP1 and TICAM1 uses \"RO:0002409\" which is not one of the standard causal relations mentioned in the instructions (appears to be related to autophagy). Consider whether this should be explicitly documented or use a more standard relation with additional context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the key findings from Yang et al. (2017) that TRIM32 negatively regulates TLR3/4-mediated innate immune responses by promoting selective autophagic degradation of TICAM1 through TAX1BP1. The biological content is consistent with:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The interaction and functional relationships between all proteins involved\n",
      "2. The subcellular locations of the activities\n",
      "3. The relevant biological processes\n",
      "4. The human-specific nature of this pathway\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that effectively captures a significant regulatory mechanism in TLR3/4 signaling. It accurately represents the role of TRIM32 and TAX1BP1 in the selective autophagic degradation of TICAM1, providing a clear visualization of how this process negatively regulates TLR3/4-mediated innate immune responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is parsimonious, focusing on the key components and activities necessary to understand this regulatory mechanism. Minor improvements could be made by adding missing evidence and potentially expanding the model to include additional downstream components, but these are not critical issues.\n",

      "   - Part of G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle (GO:0000086)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",

      "## Model Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current knowledge of the ATR-mediated S/G2 checkpoint:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ETAA1 activation of ATR**: This is well supported by the literature. ETAA1 contains an ATR-activating domain (AAD) that directly stimulates ATR kinase activity independently of TopBP1 (PMID:27723717).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **ATR inhibition of CDK1**: The model correctly represents that ATR imposes a checkpoint that restricts CDK1 activity during S-phase to prevent premature entry into G2 phase (PMID:30139873).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **CDK1 activation of FOXM1**: This relationship is well established. CDK1 phosphorylates FOXM1 at Thr-596 and Ser-678, creating docking sites for PLK1, which further phosphorylates and activates FOXM1 (PMID:19160488).\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Conventions\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate use of molecular function terms**: Each protein is correctly associated with its known molecular function.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Appropriate use of biological process terms**: The processes \"mitotic G2/M transition checkpoint\" and \"G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle\" are correctly used.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate use of causal relations**: The model uses the correct RO relations for positive and negative regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence citations**: All activities and causal relations have appropriate evidence codes and literature citations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Improvement Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is well-constructed, there are a few potential improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Include PLK1 in the model**: The pathway from CDK1 to FOXM1 involves PLK1 as an important intermediary. CDK1 phosphorylates FOXM1, creating docking sites for PLK1, which further phosphorylates and activates FOXM1 (PMID:19160488). Adding this component would make the regulation of FOXM1 more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify TopBP1-independent pathway**: The model represents the ETAA1-mediated activation of ATR. It might be worth noting that this is a parallel pathway to the canonical TopBP1-mediated ATR activation. Both pathways function together to ensure robust ATR signaling (PMID:27723717).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include downstream targets of FOXM1**: FOXM1 regulates the expression of several key mitotic genes, including PLK1, Cyclin B1, and Aurora B (PMID:19160488). Including these targets would provide a more complete picture of how this pathway regulates mitotic progression.\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "GO-CAM model gomodel:653b0ce600000721 provides an accurate representation of the ATR-mediated checkpoint that restricts CDK1 activation during S-phase. It correctly captures the roles of ETAA1, ATR, CDK1, and FOXM1 in this process and uses appropriate GO terms and relations to model their interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by current literature and follows GO-CAM curation practices. With the suggested minor additions, it could more comprehensively represent the biological pathway, particularly the involvement of PLK1 in linking CDK1 to FOXM1 activation and the downstream effects of FOXM1 on the expression of mitotic regulators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed model that provides valuable insights into the regulation of the G2/M transition checkpoint by ATR.\n",

      "- EIF2A activates EIF2S2 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the mechanism described in the literature (PMID:29084250), where KSHV ORF57 directly binds to both PACT and PKR, preventing their interaction and subsequent PKR activation. This prevents PKR from phosphorylating eIF2α, which would otherwise inhibit translation initiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the central role of ORF57 in disrupting the host's antiviral response by blocking stress granule formation through inhibition of the PKR pathway. This mechanism is consistent with viral strategies to maintain host cell translation machinery for viral protein synthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. Correct use of molecular function terms for each protein\n",
      "2. Appropriate causal relationship predicates connecting activities\n",
      "3. Proper cellular locations indicated (cytoplasm GO:0005737)\n",
      "4. Well-evidenced with appropriate literature references\n",
      "5. Biological processes appropriately indicated:\n",
      "   - Translational initiation (GO:0006413) for translation factors\n",
      "   - Antiviral innate immune response (GO:0140374) for PKR\n",
      "   - KSHV suppression of host PKR/eIF2alpha signaling (GO:0039580) for viral ORF57\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Complex Representation**: The model doesn't explicitly represent the eIF2 complex, which includes EIF2S1, EIF2S2, and EIF2S3. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, when specific subunits carry known activities, they should be represented individually, which is done here, but the relationship to the complex could be clarified.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Phosphorylation Representation**: While the causal relationships are correct, the specific molecular detail that PKR phosphorylates eIF2α isn't explicitly captured in the model. It's implied by the protein kinase activity, but using a more specific term for phosphorylation might improve the model's clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **PMID Citation Issue**: One of the references (PMID:248628414) appears to be incorrect as it contains too many digits for a standard PMID. This should be verified and corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Completeness**: The model doesn't capture that the ultimate effect of this pathway is inhibition of stress granule formation, which is a key biological outcome described in the primary paper. This could be included to provide a more complete picture of the biological significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is scientifically accurate and technically well-constructed. It effectively captures the core mechanism by which KSHV ORF57 inhibits the host PKR-mediated antiviral response. The model follows most GO-CAM best practices and provides valuable insights into virus-host interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further enhance this model, I recommend:\n",
      "1. Correcting the potentially erroneous PMID citation\n",
      "2. Considering the addition of the stress granule formation inhibition as a downstream effect\n",
      "3. Potentially clarifying the relationship between the individual eIF2 subunits and the complex\n",
      "4. Adding a more specific term to capture the phosphorylation aspect of PKR activity on eIF2α\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this model is valid and provides a useful representation of the KSHV ORF57 inhibition of host PKR pathway, which helps explain how this virus evades host antiviral defense mechanisms.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Model Structure Assessment\n",

      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",

      "### 1. Key Activities and Proteins\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ZDHHC19 (Q8WVZ1)** catalyzes protein-cysteine S-palmitoyltransferase activity (GO:0019706) - This enzyme adds palmitate to p62, which enhances its function.\n",

      "2. **SQSTM1/p62 (Q13501)** performs protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674) - This is the central protein that serves as an autophagy receptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **LYPLA1/APT1 (O75608)** catalyzes palmitoyl-(protein) hydrolase activity (GO:0008474) - This enzyme removes palmitate from p62, thereby regulating its function.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **SQSTM1/p62 (Q13501)** also performs ubiquitin-modified protein reader activity (GO:0140036) and molecular condensate scaffold activity (GO:0140693) in the model.\n",

      "- Membraneless organelle assembly (GO:0140694) - associated with p62's condensate scaffold activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following causal associations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- ZDHHC19's palmitoyltransferase activity **directly positively regulates** (RO:0002629) p62's protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\n",

      "- p62's condensate scaffold activity **directly positively regulates** (RO:0002629) p62's protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Cellular Location\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately places:\n",
      "- p62's adaptor activity in the autophagosome (GO:0005776)\n",
      "- p62's ubiquitin reader activity in the cytosol (GO:0005829)\n",
      "- p62's condensate scaffold activity in intracellular non-membrane-bounded organelle (GO:0043232)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation of Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is highly consistent with the current scientific literature about p62 regulation by palmitoylation as evidenced by the recent publication (PMID:37802024). Key scientific points correctly captured include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **S-acylation of p62**: The model correctly identifies ZDHHC19 as the primary S-acyltransferase that adds palmitate to p62, promoting its function in selective autophagy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Deacylation of p62**: The model correctly identifies LYPLA1 (APT1) as the deacylation enzyme that removes palmitate from p62, inhibiting its autophagic function.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Effect on aggrephagy**: The model accurately reflects that palmitoylation promotes aggrephagy (positive regulation) while depalmitoylation inhibits it (negative regulation).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Phase separation dynamics**: The model captures p62's role in forming condensates (bodies) through its molecular condensate scaffold activity, which is influenced by its palmitoylation status.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Subcellular localization**: The model correctly annotates the relevant cellular compartments where these activities occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Adherence to GO-CAM Curation Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Term usage**: The model uses appropriate GO terms for molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence codes**: All activities are supported with ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) linked to the same reference (PMID:37802024), which is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**: The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) and RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) to show the causal influences between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Part-of relationships**: Each activity is correctly annotated as being part of an appropriate biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional evidence**: While the model is well supported by the primary reference (PMID:37802024), it could be strengthened by adding additional references for some activities, particularly for the well-established roles of p62 in autophagy that predate the discovery of its palmitoylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular details**: The model could be enhanced by capturing the specific cysteine residues (Cys289 and Cys290) in p62 that are the targets of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation, possibly as a note.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional context**: The model could benefit from including information about how p62 palmitoylation enhances its association with LC3 on autophagic membranes, which is a key mechanism described in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Completeness**: The model could be expanded to show p62's interaction with LC3 proteins on the autophagosome membrane, which is mentioned in the reference paper as being facilitated by palmitoylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Regulation of aggrephagy via palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of SQSTM1 by ZDHHC19 and LYPLA1, respectively (Human)\" (gomodel:654d809000000010) is scientifically accurate, well-structured, and adheres to GO-CAM curation best practices. It effectively captures the novel regulatory mechanism of p62-mediated selective autophagy through reversible palmitoylation as described in the recent literature.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:654d809000000112](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:654d809000000112)) titled \"SQSTM1 is involved in aggrephagy by mediating recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins to autophagosomes (Human)\" describes the role of the p62/SQSTM1 protein in selective autophagy, specifically in the process of aggrephagy (clearance of protein aggregates by autophagy).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Accuracy and Completeness\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly illustrates the key functions of SQSTM1/p62 in the selective autophagy pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ubiquitin reader activity (GO:0140036)** - The model accurately shows that p62 functions as a reader of ubiquitinated proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular adaptor activity (GO:0030674)** - The model correctly shows p62 functioning as a protein-macromolecule adaptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular condensate scaffold activity (GO:0140693)** - The model appropriately includes p62's role in phase separation and formation of membraneless organelles.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological processes** - The model connects these activities to the correct biological processes:\n",
      "   - Aggrephagy (GO:0035973)\n",
      "   - Protein targeting to vacuole involved in autophagy (GO:0071211)\n",
      "   - Membraneless organelle assembly (GO:0140694)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cellular components** - The model correctly places these activities in the appropriate subcellular locations:\n",
      "   - Cytosol (GO:0005829)\n",
      "   - Autophagosome (GO:0005776)\n",
      "   - Intracellular membraneless organelle (GO:0043232)\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Causal relationships** - The model uses appropriate causal predicates to link the activities:\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) is correctly used to show how the ubiquitin reader activity promotes condensate scaffold activity, and how condensate scaffold activity promotes the adaptor activity.\n",
      "   - RO:0002413 (provides input for) is correctly used to show how ubiquitin ligase activity provides input for the p62 ubiquitin reader function.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately captures the sequential steps in p62-mediated selective autophagy pathway:\n",
      "   - Recognition of ubiquitinated proteins\n",
      "   - Formation of condensates/p62 bodies\n",
      "   - Targeting these condensates to autophagosomes\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The model effectively incorporates recent scientific findings about p62's role in phase separation and the formation of biomolecular condensates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The evidence cited in the model comes from appropriate, peer-reviewed literature sources that support the assertions made.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is largely accurate and well-constructed, there are a few potential improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Post-translational modifications of p62** - Recent research (as seen in PMID:31857589 and PMID:37802024) has revealed that post-translational modifications, including acetylation (at K420 and K435) and S-acylation (at C289 and C290), regulate p62's ability to form condensates and recruit autophagic machinery. These modifications could be added to provide a more complete picture of p62 regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional interacting partners** - The model could include additional proteins known to interact with p62 during autophagy, such as:\n",
      "   - The ATG8 family proteins (LC3A/B, GABARAP, etc.) which interact with p62's LIR motif\n",
      "   - KEAP1, which interacts with p62 and is involved in the NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway\n",
      "   - Deacetylases like HDAC6 that regulate p62 activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Selective autophagy regulatory mechanisms** - The model could be expanded to include how p62-mediated selective autophagy is regulated under different conditions (e.g., nutrient starvation, proteasomal inhibition).\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the GO-CAM best practices documents, this model follows the proper conventions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation** - The model correctly shows a ubiquitin ligase complex (GO:0000151) as the entity that carries out ubiquitin protein ligase activity, which aligns with the guidance in \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" when the specific subunit carrying the activity is not known.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Adaptor protein annotation** - The model correctly implements the adaptor protein annotation guidelines, showing p62 as a bridge between ubiquitinated proteins and autophagic machinery.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal connections** - The causal connections between activities are appropriate and follow GO-CAM guidelines for specifying relationships between molecular functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, [gomodel:654d809000000112](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:654d809000000112) is a high-quality GO-CAM model that accurately represents the role of SQSTM1/p62 in aggrephagy. It correctly captures the molecular functions, biological processes, and causal relationships involved in this pathway. While there are opportunities to expand the model with additional details on regulation and interacting partners, the current model provides a solid representation of p62's role in selective autophagy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with current scientific knowledge and follows GO-CAM best practices for representation of protein complexes and adaptor proteins. It provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in understanding the mechanisms of selective autophagy and the role of p62/SQSTM1 in this process.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Review Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Strengths of the Model:\n",
      "1. **Appropriate Causal Flow**: The model correctly represents the sequential causal flow from CK2 kinase activity → SQSTM1 ubiquitin-modified protein reader activity → SQSTM1 molecular condensate scaffold activity → SQSTM1 adaptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-Supported by Evidence**: Each activity and causal link is supported by peer-reviewed publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct Biochemical Knowledge**: The model accurately captures the known role of CK2 phosphorylation of SQSTM1 at Ser403, which enhances SQSTM1's ability to bind ubiquitinated proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper Cellular Localization**: The model correctly places activities in their appropriate cellular compartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Clear Molecular Mechanism**: The model shows a clear pathway from kinase activity to the functional outcomes in autophagy.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Suggestions for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Phosphorylation Site Specification**: Consider explicitly noting the phosphorylation site (Ser403) on SQSTM1 that's targeted by CK2. This would make the specific molecular event clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional Important Interactions**: The model could be expanded to include MAP1LC3A/LC3 interaction with SQSTM1, which is mentioned in the UniProtKB entry and is critical for the recruitment of autophagic machinery.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Temporal Relationship**: Consider clarifying the temporal sequence of events, as SQSTM1 first forms bodies with ubiquitinated proteins (phase separation) before being recruited to autophagosomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "- Using appropriate molecular function terms for each protein\n",
      "- Properly connecting activities with causal relationships\n",
      "- Including cellular locations for activities\n",
      "- Linking activities to their broader biological processes\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, this model appropriately represents the activities of individual proteins rather than complexes, as the specific activities of CK2 and SQSTM1 are well-defined in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:654d809000000248) is a well-constructed representation of the role of CK2-mediated phosphorylation in regulating SQSTM1's function during aggrephagy. It accurately captures the molecular events and causal relationships involved in this process. The model is scientifically sound and follows GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological content aligns with current literature on SQSTM1 regulation. CK2 (CSNK2A1) phosphorylates SQSTM1 at Ser403, which enhances its binding to ubiquitinated proteins. This facilitates SQSTM1's phase separation and formation of protein aggregates (p62 bodies), which are subsequently targeted to autophagosomes for degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This model is parsimonious and focused on the key molecular events, making it easy to understand while accurately representing the biological pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This model captures the regulation of Hippo signaling pathway in humans with a particular focus on MAP4K4's role. The model represents how MAP4K4 and other kinases act in parallel to MST1/2 to activate LATS1/2, which ultimately regulates the transcriptional coactivators YAP1 and WWTR1/TAZ.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Accuracy of Biological Content\n",
      "The model accurately reflects the current understanding of the Hippo signaling pathway based on the cited literature. The key findings from PMID:35429439 and PMID:26437443 describing how MAP4K4 functions in parallel to MST1/2 to activate LATS1/2 are well represented. The model correctly captures the phosphorylation events where LATS1/2 phosphorylates and inhibits YAP1/TAZ, preventing their nuclear translocation and transcriptional coactivator functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Completeness of Pathway Representation\n",
      "The model includes the core components of the Hippo pathway from upstream kinases (MST1/2, MAP4K4) through the central LATS1/2 kinases to the downstream effectors (YAP1 and WWTR1). The causal relationships showing regulation of nuclear transcriptional coactivators are appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Support\n",
      "All activities in the model are well supported by primary literature evidence, with appropriate ECO codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) and PMID citations. The model references key papers including PMID:35429439, PMID:26437443, and PMID:15688006.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing kinase activities and transcriptional coregulation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Protein kinase activities**: The model correctly represents protein serine/threonine kinase activities (GO:0004674) for LATS1, LATS2, STK3, STK4, and MAP4K4, consistent with their established functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Transcriptional coregulator activities**: YAP1 and WWTR1 are correctly annotated with transcription coregulator activity (GO:0003712) in the nucleus, following the guidelines in the \"Transcription coregulator activity\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates:\n",
      "   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for LATS1/2 regulating YAP1/WWTR1\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for upstream kinases activating LATS1/2\n",
      "   - RO:0002413 (provides input for) where appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular locations**: Activities are appropriately contextualized with cellular locations, with kinase activities occurring in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737) and transcriptional activities in the nucleus (GO:0005634).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comment clarification**: The model includes a comment stating \"The regulation has been capture for MAP4k4 because it is the one used for experimental evidences but according to KO, at least MAP4K1, MAP4K2, MAP4K6 and MAP4K7 are also able to regulate the hippo signaling.\" This is accurate based on PMID:26437443, but it might be clearer to reword this as \"MAP4K4 has been featured as the primary regulator in this model based on experimental evidence, but knockout studies indicate that MAP4K1, MAP4K2, MAP4K6, and MAP4K7 can also regulate Hippo signaling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing link detail**: In one of the causal associations for LATS1's activity (65bc474400000651), there's a redundant causal association with no evidence:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   \"causal_associations\":[\n",
      "      {\"type\":\"CausalAssociation\",\"evidence\":[],\"predicate\":\"RO:0002629\",\"downstream_activity\":\"gomodel:65bc474400000537/65bc474400000586\"}\n",
      "   ]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This appears to be a duplicate of the properly evidenced association above it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Potential for expansion**: Given PMID:26437443 demonstrates the redundancy and parallel functions of multiple MAP4K family members, an expanded version of this model might represent the other MAP4K family members (MAP4K1/2/6/7) more explicitly, though I recognize the curator has acknowledged this in the comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is a high-quality representation of the regulation of Hippo signaling by MAP4K4 and other kinases. The biological content is accurate, evidence-based, and follows GO-CAM best practices for representing signaling pathways. The model effectively captures the parallel pathways of MAP4K4 and MST1/2 in activating LATS1/2, which subsequently regulates YAP1 and WWTR1 transcriptional coactivator activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minor issue with a redundant unevidenced causal association is the only technical flaw in an otherwise excellent model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendation\n",
      "The model is suitable for production status with only minor clarifications suggested for the comment text and removal of the redundant unevidenced causal association.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overview \n",
      "\n",
      "This model is titled \"Negative regulation of Hippo signaling by STRIPAK complex via STRN4:MAP4K4(Human).\" It focuses on signaling mechanisms in the Hippo pathway, specifically how the STRIPAK complex component STRN4 functions to negatively regulate Hippo signaling through interaction with MAP4K4.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model describes a regulatory cascade where:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The STRIPAK complex (GO:0090443) with STRN4 (UniProtKB:Q9NRL3) exhibits protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674) in the cytoplasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. MAP4K4 (UniProtKB:O95819) shows MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase activity (GO:0008349) in the cytoplasm, which positively regulates LATS1/2 kinases.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. LATS1 (UniProtKB:O95835) and LATS2 (UniProtKB:Q9NRM7) both have protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) in the cytoplasm, which directly negatively regulate the transcription coregulator activities of YAP1 and WWTR1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. YAP1 (UniProtKB:P46937) and WWTR1/TAZ (UniProtKB:Q9GZV5) exhibit transcription coregulator activity (GO:0003712) in the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. All these activities are part of the Hippo signaling pathway (GO:0035329).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Literature Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the literature cited, primarily:\n",
      "\n",
      "- PMID:35429439 - Documents the role of LATS1/2 in phosphorylating and inhibiting YAP/TAZ.\n",
      "- PMID:26437443 - Demonstrates MAP4K family kinases acting in parallel to MST1/2 to activate LATS1/2.\n",
      "- PMID:32640226 - Specifically addresses STRN4 as a key STRIPAK complex component in Hippo pathway regulation and its interaction with MAP4K4.\n",
      "\n",
      "These papers collectively describe how the STRIPAK complex through STRN4 can inhibit MAP4K4, preventing activation of LATS1/2, and thereby promoting YAP/TAZ activity by preventing their phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal relationships**: The model appropriately uses causal predicates (RO:0002630 - \"directly negatively regulates\" and RO:0002629 - \"directly positively regulates\") to connect activities in a mechanistically accurate manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence quality**: All assertions are supported by experimental evidence (ECO:0000314 - \"direct assay evidence used in manual assertion\") with appropriate literature citations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular components**: Appropriate cellular locations are specified for each activity (cytoplasm for the regulatory components, nucleus for the transcription coregulators).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistency with literature**: The model accurately represents the molecular interactions described in the supporting papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: The STRIPAK complex is represented appropriately according to GO-CAM best practices, with STRN4 listed as a member. However, as noted in the model comments, \"the information for strn4 is lost because is part of the STRIPAK complex but doesn't act out of the complex.\" This could be clarified by considering whether STRN4 has a specific activity within the complex that should be represented independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complete pathway representation**: While the model captures the key regulatory relationships, it could potentially benefit from including MST1/2 kinases, which are mentioned in the literature as acting in parallel to MAP4K4 to regulate LATS1/2. However, since the focus is specifically on the STRN4:MAP4K4 regulatory axis, this omission is reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream effects**: The model could be extended to include the specific transcriptional targets of YAP/TAZ, but this would expand the scope beyond the current focus on the regulatory mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "- All entities have appropriate ontology terms and identifiers.\n",
      "- The model appropriately uses human proteins (indicated by the Hsap suffix in labels).\n",
      "- Causal relationships are biologically accurate and well-represented.\n",
      "- The model represents a coherent biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model effectively represents the negative regulation of Hippo signaling by the STRIPAK complex through STRN4's effect on MAP4K4. It is consistent with current literature and follows GO-CAM best practices. The model clearly depicts how the STRIPAK complex (containing STRN4) inhibits MAP4K4, which would otherwise positively regulate LATS1/2 kinases that in turn inhibit YAP1/WWTR1 transcriptional coregulator activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is parsimonious and accurately represents the primary molecular events described in the literature. It provides a clear representation of this specific regulatory axis within the Hippo pathway, making it valuable for understanding this aspect of cellular signaling.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (ID: [gomodel:65c57c3400000000](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:65c57c3400000000)) represents the inhibition mechanism of the GDF15-GFRAL signaling pathway through the cleavage of GFRAL by MMP14. The model focuses on how this mechanism affects aversive signaling, which is involved in body weight regulation and appetite control in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains four key molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GDF15 [UniProtKB:Q99988]**: Functions as a hormone with growth/differentiation factor 15 activity (GO:0005179)\n",

      "3. **RET [UniProtKB:P07949]**: Acts as a receptor tyrosine kinase with transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004714)\n",
      "4. **MMP14 [UniProtKB:P50281]**: Functions as a metalloendopeptidase (GO:0004222)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Representation and Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents the GDF15-GFRAL signaling pathway and its regulation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. GDF15 hormone (GO:0005179) positively regulates (RO:0002629) GFRAL receptor activity (GO:0016167)\n",
      "2. GFRAL receptor activity positively regulates (RO:0002629) RET tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004714)\n",

      "\n",
      "The activities are appropriately placed in their biological process contexts:\n",

      "### Strengths of the model:\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly represents the biological mechanism where MMP14 cleaves GFRAL, thereby inhibiting GDF15-GFRAL signaling.\n",
      "2. **Appropriate evidence**: The model uses direct experimental evidence with relevant citations.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "1. **Missing component information**: While the model represents the inhibition mechanism, it might be helpful to include additional information about where MMP14 cleaves GFRAL specifically, although this granular information might not be available.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Potential elaboration on RET signaling**: The model could potentially be expanded to include downstream effects of RET signaling activation, such as MAPK or PI3K/AKT pathway activation, which would provide a more complete picture of the signaling cascade.\n",

      "# GO-CAM Model Review: Resolution of protein-DNA cross-links by HMCES, BRIP1/FANCJ and SPRTN\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This model represents the protein-DNA covalent cross-linking repair pathway in humans, featuring three key proteins: HMCES (Q96FZ2), BRIP1/FANCJ (Q9BX63), and SPRTN (Q9H040). The model shows how these proteins work together to resolve DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) that can interfere with DNA replication and transcription.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Content Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of protein-DNA cross-link repair as supported by recent literature. The pathway depicted aligns with the mechanisms described in the referenced publications, particularly PMID:36608669, which describes how FANCJ helicase unfolds DNA-protein cross-links to promote their repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The functional relationships between the proteins are correctly represented:\n",
      "1. HMCES (Q96FZ2) binds to abasic sites in DNA (GO:0140431) and forms covalent cross-links with DNA (GO:0160129)\n",
      "2. BRIP1/FANCJ (Q9BX63) uses its 5'-3' DNA helicase activity (GO:0043139) to unfold these cross-links\n",
      "3. SPRTN (Q9H040) then uses its metalloendopeptidase activity (GO:0004222) to cleave the protein component of the cross-link\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships using RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\" properly show how each activity leads to the next in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conformance to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Each protein is correctly associated with its molecular function\n",
      "- Each activity is properly placed in a cellular compartment (replication fork or chromatin)\n",
      "- All activities are part of the appropriate biological process (protein-DNA covalent cross-linking repair)\n",
      "- Causal relationships between activities use the correct predicate (RO:0002629)\n",
      "- Evidence codes (ECO:0000314) and PMIDs are appropriately provided for each assertion\n",
      "- Locations are appropriate: HMCES and BRIP1 are at the replication fork (GO:0005657), while SPRTN is in chromatin (GO:0000785)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Completeness and Clarity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model provides a clear and complete representation of this specific DNA repair pathway. It captures the sequential process of:\n",
      "1. HMCES binding to and forming cross-links with abasic sites\n",
      "2. BRIP1/FANCJ unfolding these cross-links through helicase activity\n",
      "3. SPRTN cleaving the protein component to complete the repair\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is parsimonious and focuses on the key activities needed to understand the pathway without unnecessary complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Supporting Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by multiple recent publications (from 2019-2023). Each assertion is backed by evidence with appropriate PMIDs, particularly:\n",
      "- PMID:36608669 (2023) - Establishing the role of FANCJ in unfolding DNA-protein cross-links\n",
      "- PMID:37950866 and PMID:37519246 (2023) - Describing HMCES self-reversal mechanisms\n",
      "- PMID:30554877 (2019) and PMID:31235913 (2019) - Foundational work on HMCES function\n",
      "- PMID:32649882 and PMID:27871366 (2020) - SPRTN's role in the process\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is scientifically accurate and follows GO-CAM best practices. No major changes are needed, but here are some minor suggestions for consideration:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model could potentially include the self-reversal mechanism of HMCES as mentioned in PMID:37950866 and PMID:37519246, though this would add complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider adding a brief comment about the medical relevance of this pathway, as mutations in these proteins are associated with diseases like Fanconi anemia (FANCJ) and Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome (SPRTN).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The model correctly focuses on the repair pathway at the replication fork, but could potentially note that these cross-links can also interfere with transcription.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is a high-quality representation of the protein-DNA cross-linking repair pathway involving HMCES, BRIP1/FANCJ, and SPRTN. It successfully integrates recent research findings into a coherent pathway model that follows GO-CAM best practices. The model will be valuable for researchers studying DNA repair mechanisms and related diseases.\n",

      "## Model Description\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the MSL complex in humans, which is responsible for histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac). The model depicts the functional roles of four key proteins (MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, and KAT8) and their interactions within the complex that lead to histone acetylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Components and Activities\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four main proteins with their activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **KAT8/MOF (Q9H7Z6)** - Histone H4K16 acetyltransferase activity (GO:0046972)\n",
      "2. **MSL1 (Q68DK7)** - Protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674)\n",
      "3. **MSL3 (Q8N5Y2)** - Histone reader activity (GO:0140566)\n",
      "4. **MSL2 (Q9HCI7)** - Chromatin-protein adaptor activity (GO:0140463)\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are represented as occurring in the nucleus (GO:0005634) and participating in positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription (GO:0045893), with the exception of MSL2 which is involved in protein localization to chromatin (GO:0071168).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents a causal cascade where:\n",
      "- MSL2 positively regulates MSL3 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "- MSL3 positively regulates MSL1 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "- MSL1 positively regulates KAT8 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate Protein Functions**: The model correctly represents the known functions of each protein based on UniProt entries and literature.\n",
      "2. **Correct Cellular Location**: All activities are appropriately located in the nucleus.\n",
      "3. **Proper Causal Relationships**: The causal flow from MSL2 → MSL3 → MSL1 → KAT8 is consistent with the literature about MSL complex assembly and function.\n",
      "4. **Evidence Quality**: The model uses high-quality evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence) and cites relevant primary literature.\n",
      "5. **Biological Process Context**: All activities are correctly contextualized within positive regulation of transcription.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Membership**: Although the model title indicates the proteins are part of the MSL complex (GO:0072487), there's no explicit annotation to show they are part of the same complex in the model. According to GO-CAM best practices for complexes, the model could be improved by either:\n",
      "   - Adding explicit complex membership annotations\n",
      "   - Using \"part_of\" relationships to the MSL complex (GO:0072487)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Physical Structure**: The model doesn't explicitly represent the structural relationships described in the literature, where MSL1 acts as a scaffold that brings together MSL3 and KAT8, as documented in the cited paper (PMID:22547026).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Substrate Representation**: While the model title mentions H4K16 acetylation, the actual histone substrate isn't explicitly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Multi-functionality of MSL2**: According to UniProt, MSL2 also has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity which isn't represented in this model. However, this may be intentionally omitted to focus on its role in the MSL complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the GO-CAM complex annotation guidelines and the proteins' UniProt entries, I recommend:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Complex Context**: Include explicit annotations showing that these proteins are part of the MSL complex (GO:0072487).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Represent Scaffold Function**: Consider adding annotations to better represent MSL1's role as a scaffold that facilitates the interaction between MSL3 and KAT8.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include Substrate**: Consider adding the histone H4 substrate to fully represent the acetylation reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Improve Documentation**: The model could benefit from additional comments that clarify the assembly and function of the MSL complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the core functions and interactions of the MSL complex in humans. The model captures the key activities of each protein and their causal relationships leading to histone H4K16 acetylation, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation. With minor enhancements, particularly regarding complex membership representation, the model could more completely represent the current knowledge about the MSL complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence used is appropriate, and the causal flow correctly describes the biological mechanism by which these proteins cooperate to acetylate histone H4K16, consistent with the published literature including the key reference PMID:22547026.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The model correctly represents the established components of the MSL complex.\n",
      "2. The causal relationships are appropriate, showing how each component contributes to the process.\n",
      "3. The model correctly annotates the molecular functions of each protein.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows best practices for GO-CAM annotation by:\n",
      "- Correctly modeling protein activities rather than proteins themselves\n",
      "- Using appropriate causal relationships between activities\n",
      "- Including proper cellular component annotations (X chromosome)\n",
      "- Linking all activities to the biological process of dosage compensation by hyperactivation of X chromosome\n",
      "- Using appropriate evidence codes and citations\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement/Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Set2 Annotation**: The model includes Set2 with H3K36 trimethyltransferase activity, which is correctly identified based on the literature. However, the UniProt entry I looked up was for Set8 (KMT5A), not Set2. This appears to be a discrepancy in the UniProt search rather than a model error, as research clearly shows Set2 is involved in H3K36 trimethylation in Drosophila and plays a role in MSL complex targeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Representation**: According to GO-CAM best practices for complex annotation, when all subunits carrying specific activities are known (as is the case here), the model should represent each individual protein's activity rather than using a complex ID. This model correctly follows this practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **MSL-2 Dual Roles**: The model represents MSL-2 with two separate activities: protein-RNA adaptor activity and chromatin-protein adaptor activity. This is appropriate as MSL-2 has been shown to interact with roX RNAs and recognize the X chromosome.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",

      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:65c57c3400000359 provides an accurate and comprehensive representation of the MSL complex and its role in Drosophila dosage compensation. The model follows GO-CAM best practices, uses appropriate causal relationships, and is supported by scientific evidence.\n",

      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the regulation of mitochondrial calcium uptake through proteolytic control of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. It focuses on how the m-AAA protease complex, composed of AFG3L2 and SPG7, regulates calcium import by cleaving SMDT1/EMRE, a key component of the MCU complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures the current understanding of mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulation as described in the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The m-AAA protease complex (AFG3L2 and SPG7) cleaves SMDT1/EMRE (Q9H4I9), which is an essential regulator of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.\n",
      "2. This proteolytic regulation limits the availability of SMDT1/EMRE for MCU assembly.\n",
      "3. The model correctly shows that MICU1 and MICU2 are calcium ion sensors that regulate MCU activity.\n",
      "4. The MCU protein (Q8NE86) is properly annotated as having calcium channel activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular functions**: The model correctly assigns molecular functions to all proteins:\n",
      "   - AFG3L2 and SPG7 are annotated with metalloendopeptidase activity (GO:0004222)\n",
      "   - MCU with calcium channel activity (GO:0005262)\n",
      "   - MICU1 and MICU2 with calcium ion sensor activity (GO:0061891)\n",
      "   - SMDT1/EMRE with protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper cellular localization**: All activities are correctly localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate biological process annotations**: All activities are properly connected to their biological processes:\n",
      "   - m-AAA protease activities to \"regulation of calcium import into the mitochondrion\" (GO:0110097)\n",
      "   - MCU, MICU1, MICU2, and SMDT1/EMRE activities to \"calcium import into the mitochondrion\" (GO:0036444)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Well-documented evidence**: All assertions are supported by published literature with appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 for direct assay evidence and ECO:0000315 for mutant phenotype evidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Correct causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationships:\n",
      "   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for m-AAA protease effects on MCU/SMDT1\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for the regulatory relationships between components of the MCU complex\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Proper handling of inputs/outputs**: The model correctly shows calcium ion (CHEBI:29108) as the chemical entity being transported by MCU.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: The model doesn't explicitly represent the m-AAA protease complex as a complex with its own ID. According to the GO-CAM guidelines on annotating complexes, when activities are shared by several proteins or when the complex has a defined ID, it's preferable to represent it as such. The m-AAA protease complex could be represented using its appropriate GO ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Temporal dynamics**: The model doesn't capture the temporal aspect of calcium signaling - specifically how MICU1 and MICU2 respond to changes in calcium concentrations to gate MCU activity differently at low vs. high calcium levels, as detailed in PMID:32494073.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulatory mechanisms detail**: The model could benefit from including more detail about how exactly AFG3L2 and SPG7 regulate the proteolysis of SMDT1/EMRE - specifically that they degrade SMDT1/EMRE before its assembly with the uniporter complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Structural features**: The model doesn't capture the structural aspects of how MICU1 occludes the pore of MCU at low calcium levels and moves away upon calcium binding, which is key to understanding the gating mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider representing the m-AAA protease as a complex using the appropriate GO term.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add annotations to represent the calcium-dependent conformational changes in MICU1/MICU2 that lead to different MCU activity states.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Include additional details about the proteolytic regulation mechanism, possibly by adding more specific causal associations that clarify the timing of SMDT1/EMRE degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider adding annotations that capture the structural basis of MCU gating by MICU1/MICU2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of how the m-AAA protease complex regulates mitochondrial calcium uptake through proteolytic control of the MCU complex components. The model is consistent with published literature, uses appropriate GO terms and relationship types, and provides proper evidence for all assertions. With minor enhancements as suggested above, this model could provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively communicates how AFG3L2 and SPG7 act as regulatory components in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis through their proteolytic activities, which has important implications for understanding mitochondrial function in both normal physiology and disease states.\n",

      "## Model Overview \n",
      "\n",
      "This model titled \"Negative regulation of Hippo signaling by SLMAP-STRIPAK complex (Human)\" represents a molecular pathway in human cells where the SLMAP-STRIPAK complex negatively regulates the Hippo signaling pathway. \n",
      "\n",
      "The model features four main activities:\n",
      "1. Protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity (GO:0004722) enabled by a FAR/SIN/STRIPAK complex (GO:0090443)\n",
      "2. Protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) enabled by STK3/MST2 (UniProtKB:Q13188)\n",
      "3. Protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674) enabled by SLMAP (UniProtKB:Q14BN4)\n",
      "4. Protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity (GO:0043539) enabled by SAV1 (UniProtKB:Q9H4B6)\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are localized in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737) and participate in either negative regulation of Hippo signaling (GO:0035331) or Hippo signaling (GO:0035329).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the scientific literature. The central paper cited (PMID:29063833) provides solid evidence for the mechanism depicted, showing how SLMAP promotes binding of the STRIPAK-PP2A phosphatase complex to MST2, leading to dephosphorylation of its activation loop and inhibition of Hippo signaling. SAV1 antagonizes this by inhibiting the phosphatase activity, promoting MST2 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other cited papers (PMID:15688006 and PMID:35429439) provide additional context on MST2/STK3's role in activating LATS kinases and the involvement of SAV1 in this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Model Structure Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The model correctly represents that SLMAP provides input for (RO:0002413) the phosphatase activity of the STRIPAK complex, which directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) STK3/MST2 kinase activity. This aligns with the literature showing SLMAP as an adaptor that recruits STRIPAK to MST2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex representation**: The model appropriately uses a GO term for the complex (GO:0090443 - FAR/SIN/STRIPAK complex) as the enabler of the phosphatase activity, while showing only PPP2CA (P67775) as a member. This is consistent with best practices for representing complexes when the exact subunit carrying the activity is known (PPP2CA is the catalytic subunit of PP2A).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Dual regulation of STK3/MST2**: The model correctly represents the antagonistic regulation of MST2 by both SAV1 (positive regulation) and the STRIPAK complex (negative regulation).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: While the model uses GO:0090443 (FAR/SIN/STRIPAK complex) with only PPP2CA listed as a member, it might be beneficial to include other known components of the STRIPAK complex that are mentioned in the paper (like STRIP1). According to the complex annotation guidelines, since PPP2CA is the main catalytic component, the current representation is acceptable, but including additional subunits would provide more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular details**: The model doesn't capture some mechanistic details from the literature, such as the autophosphorylation of MST2 at specific sites in the linker region (T336, T378) that create binding sites for SLMAP via its FHA domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream effects**: While the model focuses on SLMAP-STRIPAK's negative regulation of MST2, it could be extended to show how this ultimately affects LATS kinases and YAP/TAZ.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows key GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "- Activities are properly connected with appropriate causal relations\n",
      "- Protein-enabled activities have appropriate molecular function terms\n",
      "- Activities are properly localized to cellular components\n",
      "- Activities are organized within appropriate biological processes\n",
      "- Evidence is properly cited with supporting literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The representation of the STRIPAK complex follows the guidelines for complex annotation, using the appropriate GO term for the complex (GO:0090443) with the catalytic subunit (PPP2CA) specified.\n",

      "## Scientific Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence Base**: Each activity and association is well-supported by published literature with appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000305, ECO:0000314, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pathway Representation**: The model correctly captures key components of the TCR signaling pathway, specifically the early events involving CD53, CD45, LCK, and CD3ζ.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subcellular Localization**: All components are correctly annotated as occurring in the plasma membrane, consistent with their biological roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal Relationships**: The directional flow of signal transduction is accurately represented through the causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: The model doesn't fully capture the complexity of the TCR/CD3 complex. Based on the literature (particularly the San José et al. paper), the TCR/CD3 complex consists of six subunits and likely contains two TCR heterodimers. This complexity could be better represented using GO-CAM's complex representation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **CD45 Regulation by CD53**: The precise mechanism by which CD53 regulates CD45 could be more explicitly modeled. The Dunlock et al. paper (PMID:35767951) indicates that CD53 controls CD45 stability, mobility, and function, but the specific molecular interactions could be made clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **LCK Activation Mechanism**: The model correctly shows that CD45 regulates LCK, but doesn't capture the details of LCK activation through dephosphorylation of its inhibitory tyrosine residue (Y505). \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional Components**: Key components of the TCR signaling pathway such as ZAP70 (which is mentioned in the literature as being activated by LCK after CD3ζ phosphorylation) are not included in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Expand TCR/CD3 Complex Representation**: \n",
      "   - Consider using complex representation guidelines to model the full TCR/CD3 complex\n",
      "   - Include TCR α and β chains and other CD3 components (CD3δ, CD3ε, CD3γ)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Refine CD53-CD45 Interaction**: \n",
      "   - Add more detail about how CD53 regulates CD45, potentially including the formation of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains\n",
      "   - Include information about CD53's role in CD45RO stability as mentioned in the Dunlock paper\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expand LCK Activation Details**: \n",
      "   - Add more specific information about LCK activation, including dephosphorylation of Y505 by CD45\n",
      "   - Include LCK's autophosphorylation at Y394\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Downstream Signaling Components**: \n",
      "   - Include ZAP70 and its activation by LCK\n",
      "   - Consider adding other downstream signaling molecules like LAT and SLP-76\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider Lipid Raft Localization**: \n",
      "   - Add information about membrane microdomains and their role in organizing the TCR signaling components\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The model [gomodel:65c57c3400002666](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:65c57c3400002666) provides a solid foundation for understanding the role of CD53 in TCR signaling. It accurately captures the key players and their causal relationships in this pathway. However, it could be enhanced by including more detailed representations of protein complexes and molecular mechanisms, particularly regarding how CD53 regulates CD45 and how CD45 activates LCK. The model could also be extended to include additional components of the TCR signaling pathway downstream of CD3ζ phosphorylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with current biological knowledge and provides a valuable representation of this important immunological pathway. With the suggested enhancements, it could serve as an even more comprehensive resource for understanding T cell receptor signaling and the specific role of CD53 in this process.\n",

      "## Summary of Model Content\n",
      "This model depicts the regulation of CARD9-mediated signaling through the post-translational modifications by TRIM62 (E3 ubiquitin ligase) and USP15 (deubiquitinase). The pathway represents C-type lectin receptor (CLEC7A/Dectin-1)-mediated antifungal immunity signaling, involving the formation of the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex leading to NF-κB activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Detailed Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pathway Description**: \n",
      "   - The model accurately represents the known biology of C-type lectin receptor signaling, where CLEC7A (Dectin-1) acts as a pattern recognition receptor for fungal beta-glucans, leading to activation of CARD9 and formation of the CBM complex.\n",
      "   - The key regulatory mechanisms involving TRIM62-mediated ubiquitination (activating) and USP15-mediated deubiquitination (inhibitory) of CARD9 are correctly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Protein Functions**:\n",
      "   - **CLEC7A/Dectin-1 (Q9BXN2)**: Correctly annotated as having pattern recognition receptor activity (GO:0038187) on the plasma membrane, consistent with its role in detecting fungal cell wall components.\n",
      "   - **CARD9 (Q9H257)**: Appropriately annotated with signaling adaptor activity (GO:0035591), which aligns with its function as a scaffold protein in immune signaling.\n",
      "   - **BCL10 (O95999)**: Correctly annotated with protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674), reflecting its role in the CBM complex.\n",
      "   - **TRIM62 (Q9BVG3)**: Properly annotated with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630), consistent with its function in K27-linked ubiquitination of CARD9.\n",
      "   - **USP15 (Q9Y4E8)**: Correctly annotated with cysteine-type deubiquitinase activity (GO:0004843), accurately reflecting its role in removing ubiquitin from CARD9.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Locations**:\n",
      "   - All proteins are annotated with appropriate cellular locations consistent with their biological functions.\n",
      "   - CLEC7A is correctly located at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886).\n",
      "   - The cytoplasmic location (GO:0005737) for CARD9, TRIM62, USP15, and BCL10 is consistent with current knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Modeling Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal Relationships**:\n",
      "   - The causal relationships in the model are biologically accurate:\n",
      "     - CLEC7A → CARD9: \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629)\n",
      "     - CARD9 → BCL10: \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629)\n",
      "     - TRIM62 → CARD9: \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629)\n",
      "     - USP15 → CARD9: \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630)\n",
      "     - BCL10 → MALT1: \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Representation**:\n",
      "   - The CBM complex formation is represented according to GO-CAM best practices. The model shows how individual components (CARD9, BCL10, MALT1) interact rather than using a generic complex ID, which is appropriate when the specific activities of each component are known.\n",
      "   - The sequential activation (CARD9 → BCL10 → MALT1) correctly represents the nucleation model of CBM complex assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence**:\n",
      "   - All activities and associations are supported by appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "   - Primary research articles are cited for each relationship (e.g., PMID:26488816 for TRIM62's ubiquitination of CARD9).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quality Control Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence Code Usage**:\n",
      "   - The evidence for CARD9's part_of relationship to positive regulation of NF-kappaB signaling (GO:0043123) uses ECO:0000250 with evidence from mouse (UniProtKB:Q6QLQ4). While this is acceptable, direct human evidence would strengthen this annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Relationship Precision**:\n",
      "   - CARD9 is shown to directly positively regulate BCL10, which is accurate but could be more precisely characterized as facilitating the oligomerization of BCL10 through its CARD domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness of Model**:\n",
      "   - The model accurately depicts the key regulatory events but misses some details of CARD9 activation. For instance, the model doesn't explicitly show that CARD9 must be phosphorylated by PKCδ in addition to being ubiquitinated for full activation.\n",
      "   - The K27-linked ubiquitination specificity of TRIM62 could be more explicitly noted in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological Process Annotation**:\n",
      "   - BCL10 is annotated as part of \"positive regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction\" (GO:0043123), which is accurate, but could also be annotated as part of antifungal immune response for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activation Mechanism Refinement**:\n",
      "   - Consider adding a node for PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation of CARD9, which works in conjunction with TRIM62-mediated ubiquitination for full activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ubiquitination Specificity**:\n",
      "   - Explicitly indicate that TRIM62 mediates K27-linked ubiquitination of CARD9 at K125, which is a specific regulatory mechanism documented in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream Effects**:\n",
      "   - The model could be extended to show downstream effects of CBM complex formation, such as activation of NF-κB and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Signaling Context**:\n",
      "   - Consider adding additional context about how this pathway integrates with other immune signaling pathways, particularly its role in antifungal immunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model accurately represents the key molecular interactions involved in CARD9 regulation by TRIM62 and USP15 in the context of antifungal immunity signaling. The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes and causal relationships. The biological content is consistent with current literature and follows a logical flow that represents the known activation sequence in this pathway. With minor refinements, this model could serve as an excellent reference for understanding the regulation of CARD9-mediated immune signaling in humans.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes the molecular pathway of DUSP22-mediated inhibition of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling through the regulation of UBR2 activity, which in turn affects Lck activity. The model captures several key molecular interactions and activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. DUSP22 (Q9NRW4) has protein tyrosine/serine/threonine phosphatase activity\n",
      "2. BTRC/β-TrCP (Q9Y297) functions as a ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor \n",
      "3. UBR2 (Q8IWV8) has ubiquitin protein ligase activity\n",
      "4. Lck (P06239) has protein tyrosine kinase activity\n",

      "\n",
      "1. DUSP22's role as a negative regulator of T-cell receptor signaling by dephosphorylating UBR2\n",
      "2. BTRC (β-TrCP) serving as a ubiquitin ligase-substrate adaptor for UBR2\n",

      "\n",
      "- DUSP22: Protein tyrosine/serine/threonine phosphatase activity (GO:0008138) - appropriate given DUSP22's dual specificity\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships in the model are properly defined and follow GO-CAM guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. DUSP22 provides input for (RO:0002413) BTRC - correctly indicates that DUSP22 dephosphorylates UBR2, making it a substrate for BTRC\n",
      "2. BTRC regulates UBR2 by using a non-direct \"regulates\" relationship (RO:0002409) - This is marked as regulation but per the E3 ubiquitin ligases guideline, it should ideally be \"directly regulates\" since it's targeting UBR2 for degradation\n",
      "3. UBR2 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) Lck - correctly shows that UBR2 ubiquitinates and activates Lck\n",

      "\n",
      "### Improvement Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal relationship refinement**: The causal relationship between BTRC and UBR2 uses \"regulates\" (RO:0002409), but according to the E3 ubiquitin ligases guideline, when an adaptor protein like BTRC is targeting a protein for degradation, \"directly regulates\" would be more appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Model expansion opportunity**: The model could potentially be expanded to include:\n",
      "   - The SCF complex scaffold (CUL1) which works with BTRC to form a functional E3 ligase complex\n",
      "   - The downstream effects of Lck activation on TCR signaling (e.g., ZAP70 phosphorylation)\n",
      "   - The specific phosphatase activity of DUSP22 on UBR2 at Ser1694 and Tyr1697 residues\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence detail**: Some evidence annotations could potentially be enhanced with more specific experimental details from the primary literature.\n",

      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. The model correctly represents the inhibitory pathway from THBS1 to VEGFR2\n",
      "2. Appropriate causal relationships are used (directly positively regulates, directly negatively regulates)\n",
      "3. Correct cellular compartments are assigned\n",
      "4. Evidence is provided with appropriate PMIDs and evidence codes\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential issues\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Subcellular Location of PTPN6/SHP-1**: According to the UniProt entry, PTPN6 is primarily cytoplasmic and nuclear. The model places it at the plasma membrane. While PTPN6 can be recruited to the plasma membrane upon CD36 stimulation, it would be more accurate to indicate its primary location as cytoplasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological Process Assignment**: All activities except KDR are annotated to negative regulation of angiogenesis (GO:0016525). This seems correct based on the literature, but it would be helpful to include more specific processes for each component if available (e.g., signal transduction processes).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing Intermediate Steps**: The literature suggests that the pathway from CD36 to KDR inhibition involves additional kinases and signaling intermediates like src-family kinases. These are not represented in the model, which simplifies the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Context Specification**: The model mentions endothelial cells in the title, but the ZFA:0009065 (endothelial cell) term is in the objects list but not explicitly used in the annotations. It would be helpful to make this cellular context more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Update PTPN6 subcellular location**: Consider changing the subcellular location of PTPN6 to cytoplasm as its primary location, with a note that it can be recruited to the membrane upon CD36 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add intermediate signaling components**: If supported by the literature, consider adding intermediate signaling components between CD36 and PTPN6, such as src-family kinases that are known to be involved in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Specify cell type**: Explicitly annotate the activities to occur in endothelial cells using the existing term ZFA:0009065.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Expand biological process annotations**: Consider adding more specific biological process terms for each component to better represent their specific roles in the signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider additional VEGFR2 regulation details**: If available in the literature, add details about how PTPN6 regulates VEGFR2, such as which tyrosine residues are dephosphorylated.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the inhibitory pathway from THBS1 to VEGFR2 via CD36 and PTPN6. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing signaling receptor activities and inhibitory pathways. With a few minor adjustments as suggested above, the model would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important anti-angiogenic pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with current literature on thrombospondin-1 as an inhibitor of angiogenesis, CD36 as its receptor, and the downstream inhibition of VEGFR2 signaling. The connections between components follow GO-CAM guidelines for representing signaling pathways.\n",

      "\n",
      "This model represents the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex (also called uniplex complex), which consists of four proteins:\n",

      "1. **MCU (Q8NE86)** - The calcium channel-forming subunit with calcium channel activity\n",
      "2. **SMDT1/EMRE (Q9H4I9)** - An essential MCU regulator with protein-macromolecule adaptor activity \n",
      "3. **MICU1 (Q9BPX6)** - A calcium sensor with calcium ion sensor activity\n",
      "4. **MICU2 (Q8IYU8)** - A calcium sensor with calcium ion sensor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows how these components interact to regulate calcium uptake into the mitochondrial matrix.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Structure and Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Core Elements of the Model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **MCU (Q8NE86)** has calcium channel activity (GO:0005262) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743), part of calcium import into mitochondrion process (GO:0036444).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **SMDT1/EMRE (Q9H4I9)** functions as a protein-macromolecule adaptor (GO:0030674) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743), part of calcium import into mitochondrion (GO:0036444), and it directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) MICU1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **MICU1 (Q9BPX6)** has calcium ion sensor activity (GO:0061891) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743), part of cellular response to calcium ion (GO:0071277), and directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) MCU.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **MICU2 (Q8IYU8)** has calcium ion sensor activity (GO:0061891) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743), part of cellular response to calcium ion (GO:0071277), and directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) MCU.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence and References:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported with evidence codes and references to primary literature. Most annotations use direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) or mutant phenotype evidence (ECO:0000315) with appropriate PMID references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Detailed Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Functions**: The molecular functions assigned to each protein are accurate based on UniProt entries and literature. MCU forms the calcium channel, SMDT1/EMRE serves as an adaptor, and MICU1 and MICU2 are calcium sensors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Subcellular Localization**: All components are correctly localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological Process**: The process annotations correctly capture the roles of these proteins in calcium import into mitochondria and cellular response to calcium.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal Relationships**: The causal relationships accurately reflect the regulatory mechanisms described in the literature, where MICU1 and MICU2 regulate MCU activity in response to calcium levels, and SMDT1/EMRE regulates MICU1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adherence to GO-CAM Guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: The model follows guidelines for representing complexes where the subunits with known activities are represented individually. This is appropriate as we know which functions each subunit performs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence Support**: Each assertion is properly referenced with appropriate evidence codes and PubMed IDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Associations**: Appropriate relation terms are used to indicate the regulation between components (RO:0002629 for direct positive regulation).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chemical Entities:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly includes calcium ion (CHEBI:29108) as both an input and output of MCU's calcium channel activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive representation**: The model captures all key components of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex and their relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-evidenced**: Each assertion is supported by appropriate evidence and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular detail**: The model captures the specific molecular functions of each component within the complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Regulatory relationships**: The regulatory relationships between components are clearly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mechanistic Detail**: While the model shows the regulatory relationships, it could provide more detail on the mechanism by which calcium binding to MICU1/MICU2 affects MCU activity. The literature indicates that at low calcium levels, MICU1 occludes the pore of the MCU channel, and at higher calcium levels, calcium binding induces a conformational change that allows calcium permeation. This mechanistic detail could be represented more explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Calcium Binding Events**: The model could explicitly represent calcium binding to the EF-hand domains of MICU1 and MICU2 as separate molecular activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Disulfide Bond Information**: The disulfide linkage between MICU1 and MICU2 is an important structural feature that could be represented more explicitly in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **SMDT1/EMRE Functions**: The model correctly represents SMDT1/EMRE as having adaptor activity, but its dual functions in gating MCU and recruiting MICU1 could be more explicitly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider adding more detail about the mechanism of calcium-dependent regulation by MICU1 and MICU2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider explicitly representing calcium binding to MICU1 and MICU2.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Consider adding annotation about the disulfide bond between MICU1 and MICU2.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider refining the representation of SMDT1/EMRE's dual functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality GO-CAM model that accurately represents the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex and its regulation. The model is well-evidenced, follows GO-CAM guidelines, and effectively captures the key molecular activities and regulatory relationships. With some minor enhancements to capture additional mechanistic details, the model would be even more comprehensive.\n",

      "# GO-CAM Review for model:65d7e4ac00001732\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM describes the activation of GPR75 (O95800) by the chemokine CCL5 (P13501) and subsequent signaling through MAP kinases in neurons. The model consists of four molecular activities linked through causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Positive Aspects\n",
      "1. **Appropriate molecular functions**: The model correctly assigns molecular functions to each protein:\n",
      "   - CCL5 is annotated with chemokine activity (GO:0008009)\n",
      "   - GPR75 is annotated with G protein-coupled receptor activity (GO:0004930)\n",
      "   - MAPK1 and MAPK3 are annotated with protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct cellular components**: The cellular locations are appropriate:\n",
      "   - CCL5 in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "   - GPR75 in plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - MAPK1 and MAPK3 in cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological processes**: The model connects activities to relevant biological processes:\n",
      "   - CCL5 to positive regulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling (GO:0045745)\n",
      "   - GPR75 to G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway (GO:0007186)\n",
      "   - MAPK1 and MAPK3 to ERK1 and ERK2 cascade (GO:0070371)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence**: All claims are supported by literature evidence, primarily PMID:29772059 which specifically describes CCL5 activation of GPR75 leading to ERK1/2 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signaling pathway completeness**: The model correctly shows CCL5 directly positively regulating (RO:0002629) GPR75, and GPR75 has input for (RO:0002407) both MAPK3 and MAPK1. However, the model could benefit from:\n",
      "   - Including the intermediate G protein components between GPR75 and the MAP kinases\n",
      "   - According to PMID:29772059, GPR75 activates a Gq signaling pathway which triggers PI3K and phospholipase C, ultimately leading to ERK activation\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Relationship between MAPK3 and MAPK1**: \n",
      "   - The model shows both MAPK3 and MAPK1 as direct targets of GPR75 but doesn't capture their relationship to each other in the kinase cascade\n",
      "   - According to the cited literature, there is typically a hierarchical activation where MAPK3 (ERK1) can activate MAPK1 (ERK2)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological context**: \n",
      "   - While the model indicates \"in neurons (Human)\" in the title, it would be beneficial to include a cell type annotation in the model itself\n",
      "   - The publication indicates that GPR75 activation by CCL5 promotes neuronal survival through the PI3K/AKT/MAPK pathway, which could be included as a higher-level biological process\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing components**:\n",
      "   - The PI3K-AKT pathway is mentioned in the literature as being activated by CCL5-GPR75 interaction but is not represented in the model\n",
      "   - Downstream effects on neuronal survival are not captured\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines,\" this model follows many best practices:\n",
      "- Correctly shows the ligand (CCL5) in extracellular space\n",
      "- Uses \"directly positively regulates\" between ligand and receptor\n",
      "- Places the receptor in the plasma membrane\n",
      "- Uses \"has input for\" from receptor to its effectors\n",
      "\n",
      "However, according to the guidelines, \"the input (target) of the receptor is the effector protein it regulates,\" and \"the causal relation between the MF of the receptor and the MF of its target is 'directly positively regulates'.\" In this model, GPR75 uses \"has input for\" (RO:0002407) rather than \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) for its relationship with MAPK1 and MAPK3.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model provides a sound representation of CCL5 activation of GPR75 and subsequent MAPK signaling based on strong evidence. To improve the model, I recommend:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Include the G protein intermediates between GPR75 and MAPKs (particularly Gq proteins)\n",
      "2. Add the PI3K-AKT pathway mentioned in the literature\n",
      "3. Change the relationship from GPR75 to MAPKs from \"has input for\" to \"directly positively regulates\" for consistency with GO-CAM guidelines\n",
      "4. Consider adding neuronal survival as a downstream biological process\n",
      "5. Add a cell type annotation to specify neuronal context\n",
      "6. Consider showing the hierarchical relationship between MAPK3 and MAPK1\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This model represents the role of RUFY1 (Q96T51) as a protein-macromolecule adaptor that mediates early endosome to Golgi transport via endosomal fusion, with involvement of Rab GTPases RAB4B (P61018) and RAB14 (P61106), along with ARL8B (Q9NVJ2). The model depicts the molecular functions of these proteins and causal relationships where ARL8B impacts RUFY1 function, which in turn affects RAB4B and RAB14 activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "1. **Accurate representation of molecular functions**: The model correctly assigns GTPase activity (GO:0003924) to RAB4B, RAB14, and ARL8B, which aligns with their known roles as small GTPases.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate cellular locations**: All activities are correctly shown to occur in the early endosome membrane (GO:0031901).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct biological process assignment**: The model appropriately associates ARL8B with protein localization to early endosome (GO:1902946) and RAB4B/RAB14/RUFY1 with both endosomal vesicle fusion (GO:0034058) and early endosome to Golgi transport (GO:0034498).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal relationships**: The model accurately depicts the relationship where ARL8B directly positively regulates RUFY1, which then directly positively regulates both RAB GTPases, reflecting the finding from the literature that ARL8B promotes RUFY1 endosomal localization and function.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence and citations**: All activities and relationships are supported by appropriate experimental evidence (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence) and cited research papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing protein complex representation**: The model doesn't explicitly represent the RUFY1-RAB14-RAB4B complex that forms on early endosomes. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guide, if the activity is shared by several proteins or if the precise subunit carrying an activity isn't known, a complex representation might be appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete representation of dynein interaction**: The recent literature (PMID:36282215) shows that RUFY1 interacts with the dynein-dynactin complex, which is important for the retrograde transport function. This interaction and its role in CI-M6PR trafficking could be added to the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing molecular function detail**: While RUFY1's protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674) is correctly captured, its RUN domain-mediated interaction with ARL8B could be more explicitly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Incomplete representation of transport process**: The model shows endosomal vesicle fusion but doesn't fully capture the complete process of cargo movement from early endosomes to the TGN.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add complex representation**: Consider adding a representation of the RUFY1-RAB14-RAB4B complex that forms on early endosomes, especially since the papers indicate this is a functional unit for endosomal tethering and fusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include dynein interaction**: Add the interaction between RUFY1 and the dynein-dynactin complex, which is important for retrograde transport. This would provide a more complete picture of how RUFY1 mediates transport.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expand molecular function details**: Add more specific molecular function annotations for RUFY1, particularly related to its RUN domain interaction with ARL8B and its coiled-coil domains' interaction with dynein.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add cargo representation**: Consider adding a representation of CI-M6PR (cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor) as cargo that gets trafficked in this process, as this would make the model more complete and biologically relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add more biological context**: Include annotations about the consequence of this transport process - the sorting of lysosomal hydrolases - to provide a more comprehensive view of the biological significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of RUFY1's role in mediating early endosome to Golgi transport with the involvement of RAB4B, RAB14, and ARL8B.

      "The model correctly represents the canonical glycogen biosynthetic pathway, starting with phosphoglucomutase (Pgm1) converting glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate, followed by UGP (UTP:glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase) producing UDP-glucose, which is then used by Gyg (glycogenin) and Glys (glycogen synthase) to build glycogen, with Agbe (branching enzyme) providing branching activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sequence of reactions and causal relationships is accurate and supported by the literature, particularly the paper by Yamada et al. (2019, PMID:30918052), which describes glycogen metabolism in Drosophila in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Annotation Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence and References**:\n",
      "   - Appropriate evidence codes are used for each annotation\n",
      "   - References include direct experimental papers specific to Drosophila (PMID:30918052, PMID:2943269) and sequence-based annotations\n",
      "   - Some annotations use sequence similarity evidence (ECO:0000250) with appropriate with_objects references\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ontology Term Usage**:\n",
      "   - Molecular function terms are correctly chosen for each enzyme\n",
      "   - All activities are correctly associated with the glycogen biosynthetic process (GO:0005978)\n",
      "   - Chemical entities are properly identified with CHEBI IDs\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Relationships**:\n",
      "   - Appropriate causal relationships (RO:0002413 - \"provides input for\") connect activities in correct metabolic order\n",
      "   - The flow of the pathway is logical and biologically accurate\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redundant Causal Associations**: \n",
      "   - The Gyg (glycogenin) activity (65d7e4ac00002191) has two identical causal associations (RO:0002413) to the same downstream Glys activity (65d7e4ac00002198). One of these appears redundant and should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Chemical Inputs/Outputs**:\n",
      "   - The model could be more complete by including all substrate inputs for each reaction. For example, UTP should be listed as an input for the UGP activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Consistency**:\n",
      "   - Some evidence references have trailing spaces in their identifiers (e.g., \"FB:FBrf0255270 | GO_REF:0000024 \"), which should be cleaned up.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing Regulation**:\n",
      "   - The model focuses on the core pathway but doesn't include regulatory elements known to control glycogen synthesis, such as insulin signaling pathway components that regulate glycogen synthase.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compliance with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM guidelines well, including:\n",
      "- Proper representation of causal relationships between activities\n",
      "- Appropriate use of occurs_in and part_of relations\n",
      "- Correct annotation of input/output molecules\n",
      "- Consistent use of evidence codes with references\n",
      "\n",
      "The model does not use complexes, so complex annotation guidelines are not applicable in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the glycogen biosynthetic pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. The activities are properly connected through causal relationships, and the annotations are supported by appropriate evidence. The minor issues identified (redundant causal association, some missing inputs) do not significantly impact the biological accuracy of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend:\n",
      "1. Removing one of the redundant causal associations from Gyg to Glys\n",
      "2. Consider adding missing substrate inputs like UTP\n",
      "3. Consider expanding the model to include regulatory elements in future iterations\n",
      "\n",
      "With these minor adjustments, this model will serve as an excellent representation of glycogen biosynthesis in Drosophila.\n",

      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the glycogen catabolic process in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and includes three key enzymes involved in this metabolic pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Glycogen phosphorylase (Glyp)** - [FB:FBgn0004507](https://bioregistry.io/FB:FBgn0004507)\n",
      "2. **Glycogen debranching enzyme (Agl)** - [FB:FBgn0034618](https://bioregistry.io/FB:FBgn0034618)\n",
      "3. **Phosphoglucomutase (Pgm1)** - [FB:FBgn0003076](https://bioregistry.io/FB:FBgn0003076)\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents the sequential enzymatic reactions in glycogen breakdown, with appropriate molecular functions, inputs/outputs, and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate representation of the glycogen catabolic pathway**: The model correctly captures the key enzymes and their sequential interactions in glycogen breakdown in Drosophila.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence support**: Most activities are supported by appropriate evidence from the literature with cited PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular details**: The model includes specific inputs and outputs for each reaction, showing the molecular transformations occurring at each step.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular location**: All activities are annotated to occur in the cytosol (GO:0005829), which is appropriate for glycogen metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Causal connections**: The model correctly depicts the flow of the pathway using the RO:0002413 \"provides input for\" relationship, showing how each enzyme's activity feeds into the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redundant activities**: There appear to be two nearly identical Glyp activities (gomodel:65d7e4ac00002290/65d7e4ac00002301 and gomodel:65d7e4ac00002290/65d7e4ac00002296). Both have the same molecular function (GO:0008184), occur in the same location (GO:0005829), are part of the same biological process (GO:0005980), and produce the same output (CHEBI:58601). This redundancy could be simplified to make the model more parsimonious.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Completion of causal chain**: The final step catalyzed by Pgm1 (phosphoglucomutase) converts alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate to alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate, but there's no indication of what happens next. Since glycogen catabolism ultimately feeds into glycolysis, it would be valuable to connect this to the glycolytic pathway or indicate that glucose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing regulation information**: The model does not capture any regulatory mechanisms for glycogen phosphorylase activation. Based on the literature, Drosophila glycogen phosphorylase is regulated by phosphorylation (converting between the active \"a\" form and inactive \"b\" form). Adding this regulatory mechanism would enhance the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Model comment clarification**: The model has a comment \"Copy from glycogen catabolic process (mouse)\" which suggests it was adapted from a mouse model. The curator should verify that all Drosophila-specific aspects of glycogen metabolism have been properly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Literature and Knowledge Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "The model aligns well with the literature on Drosophila glycogen metabolism:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The papers by Dombradi et al. (PMID:3093145) provide detailed characterization of Drosophila glycogen phosphorylase.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The sequential activities of glycogen phosphorylase, debranching enzyme, and phosphoglucomutase are consistent with established knowledge of glycogen breakdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The model correctly represents that glycogen phosphorylase produces alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The location of these activities in the cytosol is consistent with where glycogen breakdown occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. All activities are properly connected with their respective molecular functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Evidence codes are used appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The causal associations are represented correctly using the \"provides input for\" relation (RO:0002413).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The chemical entities are represented with appropriate ChEBI identifiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-structured GO-CAM model that accurately represents the glycogen catabolic process in Drosophila melanogaster. The model is consistent with the literature and follows GO-CAM best practices. The main areas for improvement involve eliminating redundancy (duplicated glycogen phosphorylase activities), potentially adding regulatory mechanisms, and completing the connection to downstream metabolic pathways.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This model ([gomodel:65d7e4ac00002427](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:65d7e4ac00002427)) represents the molecular mechanism of natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity mediated by the interaction between MICA (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A) and NKG2D (KLRK1, killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily K member 1). The model shows how MICA, a stress-induced ligand, activates the NKG2D receptor on NK cells, leading to downstream signaling events that result in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ligand (MICA) - Receptor (NKG2D) interaction**:\n",
      "   - MICA ([UniProtKB:Q29983](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q29983)) enables receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018)\n",
      "   - NKG2D/KLRK1 ([UniProtKB:P26718](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:P26718)) enables signaling receptor activity (GO:0038023)\n",
      "   - MICA directly positively regulates NKG2D\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Signaling adaptor (HCST/DAP10)**:\n",
      "   - HCST ([UniProtKB:Q9UBK5](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q9UBK5)) enables protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674)\n",
      "   - NKG2D directly positively regulates HCST\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream signaling components**:\n",
      "   - HCST directly positively regulates multiple downstream components:\n",
      "     - VAV1 ([UniProtKB:P15498](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:P15498)) with guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity (GO:0005085)\n",
      "     - GRB2 ([UniProtKB:P62993](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:P62993)) with guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor adaptor activity (GO:0005091)\n",
      "     - PIK3R1 ([UniProtKB:P27986](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:P27986)) with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulator activity (GO:0035014)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular context**:\n",
      "   - All activities are part of natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity (GO:0042267)\n",
      "   - MICA and NKG2D occur in plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - HCST downstream components (VAV1, GRB2, PIK3R1) occur in cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular representation**: The model correctly captures the MICA-NKG2D interaction and subsequent signaling through HCST/DAP10, which is supported by literature (as seen in UniProt entries).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper adaptor annotation**: HCST/DAP10 is correctly annotated as having protein-macromolecule adaptor activity, consistent with the \"How to annotate molecular adaptors\" guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complete signaling pathway**: The model represents a complete signaling pathway from extracellular ligand to intracellular effectors, providing a comprehensive view of NK cell activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper evidence usage**: Each activity and relation is supported by appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Appropriate cellular location annotations**: The model correctly locates activities in their respective cellular compartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity flow representation**: While the overall structure is correct, the signaling flow could be clarified by ensuring that the downstream components (VAV1, GRB2, PIK3R1) are connected to further downstream effectors if information is available. Currently, these proteins represent the endpoint of the signaling pathway in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex representation**: According to the UniProt entries, NKG2D and HCST form a heterohexameric complex (4 HCST + 2 NKG2D). The model could potentially include a representation of this complex structure according to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, although the current representation with direct relationships is also valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **PIK3R1 functional outcome**: The model shows PIK3R1 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulator activity but doesn't show the downstream effects on PI3K signaling. If literature supports it, adding these connections would enhance the completeness of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signaling receptor annotation**: The model correctly follows the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\" by showing MICA as having receptor ligand activity directly positively regulating NKG2D's signaling receptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular adaptor annotation**: HCST/DAP10 is properly annotated as having protein-macromolecule adaptor activity, with appropriate causal relations to downstream components, consistent with \"How to annotate molecular adaptors\" guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence and references**: Each association has appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal relations**: The model uses the appropriate causal relations (\"directly positively regulates\") for the signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the known biology of MICA-NKG2D interaction based on the UniProt entries:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **MICA as stress-inducible ligand**: MICA is correctly shown as a receptor ligand that activates NKG2D. According to UniProt, MICA is \"upregulated in stressed conditions, such as viral and bacterial infections or DNA damage response\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **NKG2D signaling through HCST**: The model correctly shows that NKG2D signals through HCST/DAP10, which is consistent with the UniProt entry stating that NKG2D \"is not capable of signal transduction by itself, but operates through the adapter protein HCST\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream signaling events**: The involvement of VAV1, GRB2, and PIK3R1 is consistent with literature, with UniProt noting that HCST \"functions as a docking site for PI3-kinase PIK3R1 and GRB2\".\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:65d7e4ac00002427 is a biologically accurate representation of MICA-NKG2D mediated NK cell cytotoxicity that follows GO-CAM best practices. The model effectively captures the signaling cascade from ligand-receptor interaction to downstream signaling components.

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model titled \"MICU3 promotes mitochondrial calcium uptake by MCU in the central nervous system (Human)\" describes the mitochondrial calcium uptake process mediated by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex and its regulatory proteins. The model focuses on how MICU3 contributes to calcium uptake in the central nervous system.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Components of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four key proteins:\n",
      "1. **MICU3 (UniProtKB:Q86XE3)** - Calcium uptake protein 3, mitochondrial\n",
      "2. **MICU1 (UniProtKB:Q9BPX6)** - Calcium uptake protein 1, mitochondrial\n",
      "3. **MCU (UniProtKB:Q8NE86)** - Calcium uniporter protein, mitochondrial\n",
      "4. **SMDT1/EMRE (UniProtKB:Q9H4I9)** - Essential MCU regulator, mitochondrial\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context and Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the functional relationships between these proteins in the mitochondrial calcium uptake process:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **MCU** is correctly annotated with \"calcium channel activity\" (GO:0005262) as it forms the channel pore through which calcium enters the mitochondria.\n",
      "- **MICU1 and MICU3** are both correctly annotated with \"calcium ion sensor activity\" (GO:0061891), reflecting their role in sensing calcium levels and regulating MCU activity.\n",
      "- **SMDT1/EMRE** is appropriately annotated with \"protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\" (GO:0030674), representing its role in connecting MCU with MICU proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subcellular locations are correctly defined, with all components localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743), which is consistent with the known biology of the MCU complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological process \"cellular response to calcium ion\" (GO:0071277) is correctly associated with MICU1 and MICU3, and MCU is properly linked to \"mitochondrial calcium ion transport\" (GO:0036444).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships in the model accurately reflect current understanding of MCU complex function:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. MICU3 \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) MCU\n",
      "2. MICU1 \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) both MICU3 and MCU\n",
      "3. SMDT1/EMRE \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) MICU1\n",
      "\n",
      "These relationships are supported by the literature as evidenced in the UniProt entries. MICU3 has a higher affinity for calcium than MICU1 and MICU2, which lowers the calcium threshold for MCU activation in tissues where it is expressed (central nervous system and skeletal muscle). This is correctly captured in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes appropriate evidence codes and literature references:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence)\n",

      "\n",
      "The model correctly includes calcium (CHEBI:29108) as an input and output for the MCU calcium channel activity, which accurately represents the calcium transport process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation Against GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the GO-CAM guidelines for complexes, this model follows best practices:\n",
      "- The activities of individual components of the MCU complex are known and correctly represented\n",
      "- The molecular functions are accurately assigned to specific proteins\n",
      "- The causal relationships between the activities are appropriately defined\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tissue specificity**: The model correctly captures the tissue-specific role of MICU3 in the central nervous system.\n",
      "2. **Functional relationships**: The regulatory relationships between the proteins are accurately represented.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Review of GO-CAM Model: gomodel:65d7e4ac00002808\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents how MCUB (Q9NWR8) inhibits mitochondrial calcium uptake through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex (also called the uniplex) to prevent calcium overload in human mitochondria. The uniplex complex consists of MCU (Q8NE86), MICU1 (Q9BPX6), MICU2 (Q8IYU8), and SMDT1/EMRE (Q9H4I9).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Accuracy of Molecular Functions\n",
      "1. **MCUB (Q9NWR8)** - Annotated with \"calcium channel inhibitor activity\" (GO:0019855) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743). This is accurate as the literature confirms MCUB acts as a dominant negative regulator that displaces MCU from the functional uniplex complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MCU (Q8NE86)** - Annotated with \"calcium channel activity\" (GO:0005262) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743). This is correct as MCU is the pore-forming unit of the channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **MICU1 (Q9BPX6)** - Annotated with \"calcium ion sensor activity\" (GO:0061891) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743). This is accurate as MICU1 contains EF-hand domains that sense calcium levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **MICU2 (Q8IYU8)** - Annotated with \"calcium ion sensor activity\" (GO:0061891) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743). This is correct as MICU2 also contains EF-hand domains for calcium sensing.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **SMDT1/EMRE (Q9H4I9)** - Annotated with \"protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\" (GO:0030674) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743). This is correct as EMRE serves as an essential adaptor that bridges MCU with the regulatory MICU subunits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Accuracy of Biological Processes\n",
      "1. **MCUB** - \"negative regulation of calcium import into the mitochondrion\" (GO:0110099). This accurately represents MCUB's role.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MCU** - \"calcium import into the mitochondrion\" (GO:0036444). This accurately represents MCU's main role.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **MICU1 & MICU2** - \"cellular response to calcium ion\" (GO:0071277). This accurately captures their role in responding to cytosolic calcium levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **SMDT1/EMRE** - \"calcium import into the mitochondrion\" (GO:0036444). This correctly identifies EMRE's role in enabling calcium import through MCU.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Accuracy of Causal Relationships\n",
      "1. **MCUB directly negatively regulates MCU** - Represented by the causal association with predicate \"RO:0002630\" (directly negatively regulates). This is accurate as MCUB displaces MCU from the complex and decreases the association of MICU1 and MICU2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MICU1 directly positively regulates MCU** - Represented by causal association with predicate \"RO:0002629\" (directly positively regulates). This is accurate as MICU1 helps regulate the opening of the MCU channel at high calcium levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **MICU2 directly positively regulates MCU** - Represented by causal association with predicate \"RO:0002629\" (directly positively regulates). This is accurate as MICU2 works with MICU1 to regulate the MCU channel opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **SMDT1/EMRE directly positively regulates MICU1** - Represented by causal association with predicate \"RO:0002629\" (directly positively regulates). This is accurate as EMRE is required to bridge MCU with MICU1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence and References\n",
      "The model incorporates evidence from several key publications:\n",
      "- PMID:31533452 - Details MCUB's role in displacing MCU from the uniplex complex\n",
      "- PMID:21685888 - Early work identifying MCU as the pore-forming unit\n",
      "- PMID:32494073 - Describes the structure and mechanism of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter holocomplex\n",
      "- PMID:24231807 - Identifies EMRE as an essential component of the complex\n",
      "- PMID:24560927 - Describes the roles of MICU1 and MICU2 in fine-tuning MCU activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence codes used (ECO:0000314 for direct assay and ECO:0000315 for mutant phenotype) are appropriate for the annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Representation\n",
      "The model correctly represents:\n",
      "1. The inhibitory effect of MCUB on MCU calcium transport activity\n",
      "2. The calcium sensing roles of MICU1 and MICU2\n",
      "3. The adaptor function of SMDT1/EMRE in connecting MCU to MICUs\n",
      "4. The causal relationships between components\n",
      "\n",
      "### Location Information\n",
      "All components are correctly located in the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743), which is accurate according to the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chemicals Represented\n",
      "The model correctly includes calcium(2+) (CHEBI:29108) as an input and output of MCU's calcium channel activity, and as an input for MICU1 and MICU2's calcium ion sensor activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Stoichiometry Representation**: The model could potentially benefit from explicitly noting the 4:4:1:1 stoichiometry of MCU:EMRE:MICU1:MICU2 in the functional uniplex as described in the literature (PMID:32494073). However, GO-CAM may not have a standard way to capture stoichiometry information.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional Mechanistic Details**: The model could potentially include that MICU1 uses its K/R ring to seal the MCU pore in low calcium conditions, and that calcium binding to MICU1/MICU2 causes conformational changes that move MICU1 away from the pore to allow calcium permeation. However, this level of molecular detail may be beyond the scope of the current GO-CAM model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Disulfide Bond Representation**: The covalent linkage (disulfide bond) between MICU1 and MICU2 could be mentioned, though again this may be beyond the current GO-CAM representation capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:65d7e4ac00002808) accurately represents the current scientific understanding of how MCUB inhibits mitochondrial calcium uptake by the uniplex complex. The model correctly defines the molecular functions, subcellular locations, biological processes, and causal relationships between the components based on strong supporting evidence from the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model makes appropriate use of GO terms and relationship types to describe the biological system. The evidence provided through citations and evidence codes is strong and current. The model effectively captures the key biological mechanisms without unnecessary complexity.\n",

      "# GO-CAM Review: Ufmylation pathway (Human)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes the Ufmylation pathway in humans, which is a post-translational modification pathway involving the ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1). The model correctly represents the key components and causal relationships in this pathway, capturing the enzymatic cascade that leads to protein UFMylation. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents a well-constructed and evidence-supported representation of the UFMylation pathway. It accurately captures the functional roles of the four key proteins in this pathway and their causal relationships, with appropriate literature citations and evidence codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive representation**: The model includes all the key components of the UFMylation pathway: UBA5 (E1 activating enzyme), UFC1 (E2 conjugating enzyme), UFL1 (E3 ligase), and UFSP1 (UFM1-specific protease).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The model correctly represents the causal flow from protein maturation through the enzymatic cascade using the \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) predicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Strong evidence base**: Each association in the model is supported by appropriate evidence, with multiple recent publications (2020-2024) cited. This reflects the current understanding of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular localization**: The model correctly indicates that UFSP1 activity occurs in the cytosol (GO:0005829), which is consistent with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Correct molecular functions**: Each protein is assigned the appropriate molecular function:\n",
      "   - UFSP1: cysteine-type peptidase activity (GO:0008234)\n",
      "   - UFL1: UFM1 ligase activity (GO:0061666)\n",
      "   - UFC1: UFM1 conjugating enzyme activity (GO:0061657)\n",
      "   - UBA5: UFM1 activating enzyme activity (GO:0071566)\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Up-to-date scientific knowledge**: The model incorporates recent findings about UFSP1 (2022-2023), which corrected previous misconceptions about its catalytic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Potential Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional cellular components**: The model could be enhanced by including the cellular localization for UFL1, UFC1, and UBA5. According to the literature:\n",
      "   - UFL1 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane\n",
      "   - UFC1 is distributed throughout the cell\n",
      "   - UBA5 is primarily cytosolic but can also be found in the nucleus and ER membrane\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Substrates of UFMylation**: The model could potentially include the main substrate of this pathway, RPL26 (ribosomal protein L26), which is the principal target of UFMylation according to recent literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing regulatory components**: The model doesn't include DDRGK1 (also known as UFBP1) and CDK5RAP3, which are important additional components of the UFM1 E3 ligase complex that work with UFL1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological outcomes**: The model could be extended to include the biological consequences of UFMylation, such as ribosome recycling from the ER translocon.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Correctness\n",
      "\n",
      "From a technical perspective, the model is correctly constructed according to GO-CAM standards:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Each protein is appropriately linked to its molecular function via \"enabled by\" relations.\n",
      "2. The causal flow follows the standard \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) predicate.\n",
      "3. All activities are indicated to be part of the broader biological process \"protein ufmylation\" (GO:0071569).\n",
      "4. UFSP1's activity is additionally indicated to be part of \"protein maturation\" (GO:0051604).\n",
      "5. Evidence codes are appropriate (ECO:0000314 for direct assay evidence, ECO:0000315 for mutant phenotype evidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of the UFMylation pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. UFSP1 is now recognized as an active protease that cleaves the C-terminal peptide of pro-UFM1 to generate mature UFM1 (based on 2022-2023 research).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The enzymatic cascade follows the established order:\n",
      "   - UBA5 activates UFM1 in an ATP-dependent manner\n",
      "   - UFC1 accepts the activated UFM1 from UBA5\n",
      "   - UFL1 transfers UFM1 from UFC1 to target proteins\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The model correctly identifies that UFSP1 provides input for UBA5's activity through its role in maturing pro-UFM1.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides an accurate and well-supported representation of the human UFMylation pathway. It correctly captures the enzymatic cascade, molecular functions, and causal relationships between the key components.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be enhanced by including additional components (DDRGK1, CDK5RAP3), cellular locations for all proteins, and downstream biological consequences of UFMylation. Nevertheless, as it stands, the model represents a high-quality contribution to our understanding of post-translational modifications in human cells.\n",

      "\n",
      "The model titled \"Ufmylation of CYB5R3 promotes reticulophagy and CYB5R3 degradation (Human)\" depicts a biological process involving the UFM1 system in the regulation of ER-phagy (reticulophagy) in humans. The model shows how UFM1, a ubiquitin-like modifier, is conjugated to CYB5R3 (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 3) through an enzymatic cascade involving the E3 UFM1-protein ligase complex, which promotes lysosomal degradation of CYB5R3.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the recent findings from Ishimura et al. (2022) [PMID:36543799], which identified CYB5R3 as a substrate for the UFM1 system. The scientific content is consistent with current literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The UFM1 system consists of E1 (not shown in the model), E2 (not shown), and E3 (represented by UFL1 and CDK5RAP3) components.\n",
      "2. CYB5R3 is accurately depicted as being ufmylated by UFL1 (E3 UFM1-protein ligase 1).\n",

      "4. The model shows UFSP2 as having deUFMylase activity, which is accurate.\n",
      "5. The connections between these components reflect our current understanding of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Model Structure Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activities are properly connected**: The model shows a coherent flow of activities using appropriate causal relations:\n",
      "   - CDK5RAP3's activity provides input for UFL1's activity (RO:0002413)\n",
      "   - UFL1's activity directly positively regulates CYB5R3's activity (RO:0002629)\n",
      "   - UFSP2's activity directly negatively regulates CYB5R3's activity (RO:0002630)\n",
      "   - DDRGK1's activity directly negatively regulates CYB5R3's activity (RO:0002630)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular function terms are appropriate**:\n",
      "   - UFL1: \"E3 UFM1-protein ligase activity\" (GO:0061666)\n",
      "   - UFSP2: \"deUFMylase activity\" (GO:0071567)\n",
      "   - DDRGK1: \"UFM1-modified protein reader activity\" (GO:0141185)\n",
      "   - CDK5RAP3: \"ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity\" (GO:1990756)\n",
      "   - CYB5R3: \"cytochrome-b5 reductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H\" (GO:0004128)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological process terms are appropriate**:\n",
      "   - UFL1 and CDK5RAP3 are part of \"protein ufmylation\" (GO:0071569)\n",
      "   - DDRGK1 is part of \"positive regulation of reticulophagy\" (GO:0140501)\n",
      "   - UFSP2 is part of \"negative regulation of proteolysis involved in protein catabolic process\" (GO:1903051)\n",
      "   - CYB5R3 is part of \"blood circulation\" (GO:0008015)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular location information is included**:\n",
      "   - UFL1, DDRGK1, and CYB5R3 are correctly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (GO:0005789)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Control Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the core UFM1 system components involved in CYB5R3 ufmylation.\n",
      "2. The causal relationships between activities are appropriate.\n",
      "3. Evidence codes and PMIDs are properly used to support the annotations.\n",
      "4. The model captures the biological context of reticulophagy and CYB5R3 degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incomplete representation of the E1 and E2 components**: The model doesn't include UBA5 (E1) and UFC1 (E2), which are essential parts of the UFM1 conjugation system. While focusing on the E3 components is reasonable for simplicity, it might be worth noting their absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological process annotation for CYB5R3**: CYB5R3 is annotated with \"blood circulation\" (GO:0008015), which, while not incorrect, doesn't directly relate to its role in this specific context. A more contextually relevant biological process term such as \"reticulophagy\" (GO:0061709) would better reflect its role in this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence code for CYB5R3's biological process**: The evidence code for CYB5R3's involvement in blood circulation is ECO:0000304 (author statement supported by traceable reference), but the PMID cited (1400360) is from 1992 and doesn't directly relate to the reticulophagy context. A more recent reference specifically addressing CYB5R3's role in ER-phagy would be more appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **DDRGK1 naming**: The model uses DDRGK1, while recent literature often refers to this protein as UFBP1. For clarity, it might be helpful to note this alias.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Final Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model presents a scientifically accurate representation of the UFM1 system's role in CYB5R3 ufmylation and subsequent degradation through reticulophagy. The model follows GO-CAM best practices and effectively communicates the biological process. With minor adjustments to the biological process annotation for CYB5R3 and possibly the inclusion of E1 and E2 components, this model would provide an even more comprehensive view of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully captures a specific aspect of the UFM1 system that has important implications for ER homeostasis and potentially for neuronal development, as suggested by the source literature. The recent findings on the UFM1 system's role in ribosome recycling provide additional context but don't directly impact this model's validity.\n",

      "### Model Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the information gathered, I'll review this model for accuracy, consistency with GO-CAM best practices, and biological plausibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Scientific Content and Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Overall Biology**: The model represents a pathway where UFL1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through ufmylation of PD-1 (PDCD1), which is consistent with the recent publication (PMID:38377992) cited. The pathway shows how UFL1's UFM1 ligase activity is regulated by YWHAG (which is itself regulated by PRKAA1), and how UFL1 affects PD-1 stability and function by affecting the ubiquitin-like ligase activities of KLHL22 and FBXO38.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Function of UFL1**: The model correctly represents UFL1 as an E3 UFM1-protein ligase with GO:0061666 (UFM1 ligase activity). This aligns with the UniProt entry which describes UFL1 as a protein that \"mediates ufmylation, the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like modifier UFM1 to lysine residues on target proteins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulation of PD-1**: The model shows that UFL1 influences PDCD1/PD-1, which is supported by UniProt that states UFL1 \"acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation by mediating ufmylation and stabilization of PDCD1/PD-1.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **YWHAG role**: The representation of YWHAG as having protein sequestering activity that regulates UFL1 is consistent with the UniProt entry that states UFL1 \"Interacts (when phosphorylated) with YWHAG/14-3-3-gamma; sequestering UFL1 and preventing its association with PDCD1/PD-1 substrate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### GO-CAM Model Structure and Best Practices Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity Representation**: Each protein's activity is appropriately represented with the correct molecular function term.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Component Annotation**: The model appropriately includes cellular component annotations for the membrane-bound proteins (PDCD1 and CD274) as occurring in the plasma membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Relationships**: \n",
      "   - The model uses \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) to show upstream activities that feed into downstream ones.\n",
      "   - It uses the appropriate negative effect relation (RO:0002409) to represent the inhibitory effects of the ubiquitin-like ligase adapter activities on PD-1.\n",
      "   - The model uses RO:0012010 for some regulatory relationships, but the specific meaning of this relation is not clear from the context provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Process Context**: Each activity is properly associated with an appropriate biological process, showing both the local processes (like protein stabilization) and the broader context (regulation of T cell immune response).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence**: Each relationship and activity is appropriately supported with evidence codes and references to the primary literature (PMID:38377992 and others).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Relation RO:0012010**: The model uses RO:0012010 to represent some regulatory relationships, but it's not one of the standard causal association predicates listed in your guidance. I recommend verifying the appropriate use of this relation or replacing it with one of the standard predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **UFMylation Mechanism**: The model represents UFL1's regulatory effect on PDCD1 as indirect (through KLHL22 and FBXO38), but UniProt suggests that UFL1 directly ufmylates PDCD1. The model should clarify whether the effect is direct or mediated through these adaptor proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Process Context Refinement**: While the model does associate activities with processes, it might benefit from more specific process terms for UFL1's role in protein ufmylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Phosphorylation Representation**: According to UniProt, UFL1 is phosphorylated at Thr-536 by AMPK, which promotes its interaction with YWHAG/14-3-3-gamma. This phosphorylation event could be explicitly modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **PDCD1 Ubiquitination**: The model shows regulation of PDCD1 through ubiquitin ligase adaptor activities, but could more explicitly model the ubiquitination process described in the UniProt entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is a well-constructed representation of UFL1's role in negatively regulating T-cell activation through its effect on PDCD1/PD-1. The model uses appropriate GO terms for molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes, and includes proper evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model would benefit from:\n",
      "1. Clarification of some regulatory relationships (specifically the use of RO:0012010)\n",
      "2. More explicit representation of the phosphorylation and ufmylation mechanisms\n",
      "3. Potentially more direct representation of UFL1's effect on PDCD1\n",
      "\n",
      "However, overall, the model effectively captures the key biological relationships described in the recent literature about UFL1-mediated regulation of PD-1 and T-cell activation.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model focuses on the control of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) clustering at GABAergic synapses by Gephyrin in human neurons. The model depicts several activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. GABA-A receptor activities performed by various GABAAR subunits (GABRG2, GABRB3, GABRA1, GABRB2)\n",
      "2. Protein-macromolecule adaptor activity of Gephyrin (GPHN) in clustering GABAA receptors\n",
      "3. Protein-cysteine S-palmitoyltransferase activity of ZDHHC12 in palmitoylating Gephyrin\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly represents the key roles of Gephyrin as a scaffold protein that clusters GABAA receptors at inhibitory synapses, which is well supported by literature (PMID:25025157).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The model properly depicts the causal relationship between ZDHHC12's palmitoyltransferase activity and Gephyrin's adaptor function, which is crucial for GABAAR clustering as demonstrated in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular detail**: The model includes specific GABAAR subunits (GABRG2, GABRB3, GABRA1, GABRB2) that are known to interact with Gephyrin at inhibitory synapses.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence quality**: The model uses direct experimental evidence (ECO:0000314, ECO:0000315) from peer-reviewed publications to support the relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Subcellular localization**: The model correctly annotates the activities as occurring in the postsynaptic membrane (GO:0045211), which is appropriate for this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing GABAAR complex representation**: The model represents individual GABAAR subunits carrying the GABA-A receptor activity (GO:0004890), but GABAARs function as heteropentameric complexes. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, when the activity is shared by several proteins that form a complex (like in heteromeric receptors), it would be more appropriate to represent this functional relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Redundant causal relationships**: There appear to be duplicate causal associations from GPHN to several GABAAR subunits. For example, there are two identical causal relationships from GPHN to GABRG2 with the same predicate (RO:0002629) and evidence. This is redundant and should be corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Input/output relationships clarity**: All GABAAR activities have CHEBI:17996 (chloride) as both input and output, which is appropriate for a chloride channel, but the model could benefit from including GABA (CHEBI:16865) as an input to better represent the receptor's activation mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional molecular players**: Based on PMID:25025157, Gephyrin requires palmitoylation on two specific cysteine residues (Cys212 and Cys284) to properly cluster at GABAergic synapses. The model could be enriched by including this molecular detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Activity flow representation**: While the model correctly shows that ZDHHC12 palmitoylates Gephyrin, which then clusters GABAARs, the biological process context for each activity could be more clearly defined to show the complete pathway for GABAAR trafficking and clustering.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improve GABAAR representation**: Consider representing the GABAAR as a complex using the GO term for \"GABA-A receptor complex\" (GO:1902711) for activities where the specific subunit carrying the activity is not definitively known.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Remove redundant causal associations**: Clean up the duplicate causal relationships from GPHN to GABAAR subunits.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enhance molecular detail**: Add annotations to indicate the specific palmitoylation sites (Cys212 and Cys284) on Gephyrin that are modified by ZDHHC12.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complete pathway context**: Include annotations for the broader biological processes of \"inhibitory synapse assembly\" (GO:0097091) and \"GABA signaling pathway\" (GO:0007214) to provide better context for the activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Strengthen evidence**: Consider adding evidence from additional publications to support the role of Gephyrin in clustering specific GABAAR subunits.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "GO-CAM model gomodel:65f3ae5c00002132 provides a good representation of the molecular mechanism by which Gephyrin, when palmitoylated by ZDHHC12, clusters GABAA receptors at inhibitory synapses. This is an important process for maintaining proper inhibitory neurotransmission in the human brain. The model is generally well-constructed and evidence-based but could benefit from a few refinements to better represent the complexities of GABAAR function and provide a more complete picture of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the key finding from PMID:25025157 that palmitoylation of Gephyrin by ZDHHC12 is essential for proper clustering of GABAARs at inhibitory synapses. Overall, this is a valuable contribution to understanding the molecular mechanisms of inhibitory synapse formation and function.\n",

      "The model shows a regulatory pathway through the following causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Phosphorylase kinase ([MGI:MGI:1916211](https://bioregistry.io/mgi:MGI:1916211)) directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) glycogen phosphorylase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Glycogen phosphorylase ([MGI:MGI:97829](https://bioregistry.io/mgi:MGI:97829)) provides input for (RO:0002413) multiple downstream activities:\n",
      "   - Glycogen debranching enzyme (4-alpha-glucanotransferase activity)\n",
      "   - Both phosphoglucomutase activities\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The 4-alpha-glucanotransferase activity of glycogen debranching enzyme provides input for (RO:0002413) its own amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase activity provides input for (RO:0002413) glycogen phosphorylase activity (second instance)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains appropriate evidential support:\n",
      "- Experimental evidence codes (ECO:0000314, ECO:0000315) from relevant literature\n",
      "- Multiple PMIDs are cited, including PMID:24613482 which details a mouse model of glycogen storage disease type III\n",
      "- Appropriate use of evidence codes for the different assertions\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biochemical Accuracy**: The model accurately represents the sequence of enzymatic activities in glycogen breakdown, consistent with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Evidence**: Each activity is supported by experimental evidence from literature, properly annotated with ECO terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Comprehensive Pathway Representation**: The model includes the key enzymes in the glycogen catabolic process, showing both debranching and phosphorylase-dependent degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Context**: The model correctly places these activities in the cytosol.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Causality Representation**: The causal flow between activities is logical and represents the biological sequence of events.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete Regulatory Context**: The model shows phosphorylase kinase positively regulating glycogen phosphorylase, but the upstream activators of phosphorylase kinase (such as calcium or protein kinase A) are not included. Adding these would provide a more complete regulatory context.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Metabolic Outputs**: While the model shows glucose and glucose-6-phosphate as outputs, it might benefit from showing the fate of these products (e.g., entry into glycolysis).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback Regulation**: The model doesn't include feedback regulation mechanisms that control glycogen breakdown. Including these would enhance the biological completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Alternative Debranching Pathway**: The model appropriately shows the dual activities of the glycogen debranching enzyme (Agl), but could clarify that these are two activities of the same protein rather than separate instances.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:65f3ae5c00002208) provides a well-structured and evidentially supported representation of the glycogen catabolic process in mice.

      "- **Taxon**: Mouse (NCBITaxon:10090)\n",
      "- **Status**: Production\n",
      "- **Contains**: 7 activities representing a glycogen catabolic pathway in mouse\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the glycogen catabolic process in mouse, specifically focusing on the activities of key enzymes involved in glycogen breakdown in the cytosol. The model includes appropriate molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly represents the key enzymes involved in glycogen catabolism, including:\n",
      "   - Phkg1 (phosphorylase kinase gamma 1)\n",
      "   - Pygb (brain glycogen phosphorylase)\n",
      "   - Agl (glycogen debranching enzyme with dual activities)\n",
      "   - Pgm1 and Pgm2 (phosphoglucomutases)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The model appropriately uses \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) and \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) predicates to connect activities in a biologically meaningful way.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence support**: All activities are supported by experimental evidence with appropriate ECO codes and PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper representation of dual activity**: The model correctly represents the dual enzymatic activities of the Agl protein (amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase and 4-alpha-glucanotransferase), which are important for glycogen debranching.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Inclusion of final product**: The model tracks the pathway through to the production of alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate, which is the end product of glycogen breakdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing direct evidence for causal relationships**: While the causal associations between activities (e.g., one enzyme's output feeding into another enzyme's activity) appear biologically correct, these associations lack direct evidence annotations. It would be beneficial to add evidence for these causal links.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Duplicated Pygb activities**: There are two instances of Pygb glycogen phosphorylase activity (nodes 65f3ae5c00002276 and 65f3ae5c00002283) with identical functions. This appears to be redundant and might confuse users of the model. Consider consolidating these into a single activity node.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological process associations**: Some activities are associated with the general \"biological regulation\" (GO:0065007) process rather than the more specific \"glycogen catabolic process\" (GO:0005980). For consistency, consider using the more specific process term throughout the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing spatial information**: While all activities are correctly located in the cytosol (GO:0005829), some of these locations lack evidence annotations. Consider adding evidence for all cellular locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Correctness\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing enzymatic activities and causal relationships. The use of molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes is consistent with GO-CAM modeling guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Validation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the pathway of glycogen breakdown:\n",
      "1. Phosphorylase kinase (Phkg1) activates glycogen phosphorylase (Pygb)\n",
      "2. Glycogen phosphorylase breaks down glycogen by releasing glucose-1-phosphate\n",
      "3. The debranching enzyme (Agl) with its dual activities helps process the branched portions of glycogen\n",
      "4. Phosphoglucomutases (Pgm1, Pgm2) convert glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate\n",
      "\n",
      "This matches established knowledge of glycogen metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consolidate the duplicate Pygb activities into a single node to improve clarity.\n",
      "2. Add evidence for causal relationships between activities.\n",
      "3. Ensure consistent use of specific biological process terms throughout the model.\n",
      "4. Add evidence for all cellular location associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that effectively represents the process of glycogen catabolism in mouse. With the suggested minor improvements, it would be an excellent reference model for the glycogen catabolic pathway.\n",

      "## Summary of Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes a signaling pathway in human CD4+ T cells where CD69 binding to oxidized LDL leads to the induction of PD-1 (PDCD1) expression through the activation of NFATC1 and NR4A3 (NOR-1) transcription factors. The model represents a mechanism for negative regulation of inflammatory response in the context of cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four main activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CD69 (UniProtKB:Q07108)** functioning as a transmembrane signaling receptor in the plasma membrane\n",
      "2. **NFATC1 (UniProtKB:O95644)** functioning as a DNA-binding transcription activator in the nucleus\n",
      "3. **NR4A3 (UniProtKB:Q92570)** functioning as a DNA-binding transcription activator in the nucleus\n",
      "4. **PDCD1/PD-1 (UniProtKB:Q15116)** functioning as a transmembrane signaling receptor in the plasma membrane\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents the following causal relationships:\n",
      "- CD69's transmembrane signaling receptor activity provides input for NFATC1's DNA-binding transcription activator activity\n",
      "- NFATC1's DNA-binding transcription activator activity provides input for both:\n",
      "  - NR4A3's DNA-binding transcription activator activity\n",
      "  - PDCD1's transmembrane signaling receptor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities in this model are part of the negative regulation of inflammatory response (GO:0050728).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Supporting Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by primary literature:\n",
      "- The CD69-oxidized LDL interaction and its role in PD-1 induction is supported by Jimenez-Fernandez et al. (2022) - PMID:35930205\n",
      "- NR4A3's role in the inflammatory response is supported by Zhao et al. (2010) - PMID:20558821\n",
      "- NFATC1's localization in the nucleus is supported by Sheridan et al. (2002) - PMID:8634690\n",
      "- PDCD1's transmembrane signaling receptor activity is supported by Freeman et al. (2000) - PMID:11015443\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the model:\n",
      "1. The model captures a novel pathway for PD-1 induction that is independent of typical T cell receptor signaling\n",
      "2. All components have appropriate GO terms for molecular functions\n",
      "3. All activities occur in the correct cellular compartments\n",
      "4. The model is supported by strong experimental evidence\n",
      "5. The causal connections between activities follow the biological sequence of events\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "1. **Add missing interactions**: The model doesn't explicitly show the interaction between oxidized LDL and CD69, which is a key initiating event. Consider adding oxidized LDL as a chemical entity in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify NR4A3's role**: While the PMID:35930205 suggests that NR4A3 might actually negatively regulate PD-1 expression (\"silencing NR4A3 slightly upregulated PD-1 expression\"), the model doesn't capture this nuance. This regulatory relationship could be clarified.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add downstream effects**: The model could be extended to show the functional consequences of PD-1 induction, such as inhibition of T cell activation or cytokine production.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Link to disease context**: Given the relevance to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease mentioned in the literature, making these connections explicit would enhance the model's biological context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model effectively represents a novel pathway for PD-1 induction in T cells via CD69-oxidized LDL interaction through NFATC1 and NR4A3. The model correctly follows GO-CAM best practices for depicting signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation. The model provides valuable insights into mechanisms that negatively regulate inflammatory responses in the context of cardiovascular disease and has potential implications for understanding immune checkpoint regulation in atherosclerosis.\n",

The model includes four proteins with their respective molecular functions, and a series of causal relationships that describe the signal transduction pathway leading to suppression of Th17 cell differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four proteins with the following activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **LGALS1 (P09382)**: \n",
      "   - Molecular Function: Receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018)\n",
      "   - Cellular Component: Plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - Biological Process: Negative regulation of T-helper 17 cell lineage commitment (GO:2000329)\n",

      "   - Biological Process: Negative regulation of T-helper 17 cell lineage commitment (GO:2000329)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **JAK3 (P52333)**:\n",
      "   - Molecular Function: Protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713)\n",
      "   - Cellular Component: Extrinsic component of cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane (GO:0031234)\n",
      "   - Biological Process: Negative regulation of T-helper 17 cell lineage commitment (GO:2000329)\n",

      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the following causal relationships:\n",
      "1. LGALS1 → CD69: Directly positively regulates (RO:0002629)\n",
      "2. CD69 → JAK3: Directly positively regulates (RO:0002629)\n",
      "3. JAK3 → STAT5A: Directly positively regulates (RO:0002629)\n",
      "\n",
      "This creates a signaling cascade where:\n",
      "- Galectin-1 binds to and activates CD69 receptor\n",
      "- CD69 activates JAK3's protein tyrosine kinase activity\n",
      "- JAK3 phosphorylates STAT5A, which then acts as a transcription factor \n",
      "- This pathway ultimately leads to the negative regulation of Th17 cell differentiation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Alignment with Literature Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the available literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **LGALS1-CD69 interaction**: The interaction is supported by the paper \"The leukocyte activation receptor CD69 controls T cell differentiation through its interaction with galectin-1\" (PMID:24752896), which confirmed a direct and specific interaction between CD69 and galectin-1 that is carbohydrate-dependent.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **CD69-JAK3-STAT5 pathway**: The model correctly represents that CD69 activates the JAK3/STAT5 signaling pathway, which is known to regulate T-helper cell differentiation, specifically negatively regulating Th17 cell development.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Localization**: The cellular components are correctly annotated, with LGALS1 and CD69 at the plasma membrane, JAK3 at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, and STAT5A in the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "After reviewing the GO-CAM annotation guidelines, I found that this model follows the best practices for:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signaling receptor activity annotation**: The model correctly represents the protein ligand-activated signaling receptor pattern, where LGALS1 has receptor ligand activity, CD69 has transmembrane signaling receptor activity, and they're connected by a \"directly positively regulates\" relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The model correctly uses the \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) predicate to connect activities in the signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular localization**: The model properly annotates the cellular components for each protein activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process context**: All activities are properly contextualized as part of the same biological process (GO:2000329 - negative regulation of T-helper 17 cell lineage commitment).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, here are some potential improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete downstream effects**: The model could benefit from including information about which genes are regulated by STAT5A to inhibit Th17 differentiation. This would provide a more complete understanding of the mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional evidence**: There's some duplication in the evidence attribution for the causal relationships (particularly for LGALS1-CD69 and CD69-JAK3). These should be consolidated or differentiated to improve clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback regulation**: If applicable, any feedback mechanisms that regulate this pathway could be added to provide a more comprehensive view of the biological process.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy Assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the findings from the cited research, particularly PMID:37478846 (\"UBR5 forms ligand-dependent complexes on chromatin to regulate nuclear hormone receptor stability\"). This paper demonstrates that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. UBR5 ubiquitinates multiple nuclear hormone receptors including VDR when they are bound to their respective ligands.\n",
      "2. This ubiquitination occurs when the nuclear receptors are not associated with coactivators like NCOA3.\n",
      "3. The interaction takes place on chromatin.\n",
      "4. NCOA3 and UBR5 compete for binding to the hydrophobic cleft of nuclear receptors, making their binding mutually exclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents this antagonistic relationship where NCOA3 blocks UBR5's ubiquitination of VDR by competing for the same binding site.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing complex molecular interactions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity nodes**: Each protein is represented by its molecular function\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: Appropriate causal relationship terms are used\n",
      "3. **Evidence**: Each assertion is supported by evidence from the literature\n",
      "4. **Cellular location**: All activities are correctly localized to chromatin\n",
      "\n",
      "For the representation of the competitive binding between UBR5 and NCOA3, the model uses the \"blocks\" relationship, which is appropriate to represent this mutually exclusive binding scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is scientifically accurate and well-constructed, I have a few suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional causal links**: The model could be enhanced by explicitly showing that VDR bound to calcitriol ([CHEBI:17823](https://bioregistry.io/CHEBI:17823)) is the state that enables UBR5 binding. Currently, calcitriol is listed as an object but not explicitly connected in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological Process annotation**: VDR's biological process is annotated as \"retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0048384), which is accurate based on the cited evidence. However, it might be more specific to annotate it with \"vitamin D receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0070561) as already used for NCOA3.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expanded representation**: The model could be expanded to include the downstream proteasomal degradation of VDR that follows ubiquitination, as this is a key functional outcome of this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:6606056e00000576 accurately represents the competitive binding of UBR5 and NCOA3 to ligand-bound VDR on chromatin, which determines whether VDR is ubiquitinated and degraded or participates in transcriptional activation. The model is consistent with current scientific understanding and follows GO-CAM best practices. With minor enhancements, it would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important regulatory mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively captures the key finding from the research that nuclear receptor degradation (including VDR) by UBR5 is regulated by a competitive mechanism between nuclear receptor coactivators and the ubiquitin ligase, providing an elegant switch between receptor activation and degradation.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This model ([gomodel:6606056e00000767](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6606056e00000767)) describes how the E3 ubiquitin ligases ITCH and UBR5 catalyze branched-linked polyubiquitination of TXNIP (Thioredoxin-interacting protein) in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "### Core Components:\n",
      "1. **TXNIP (UniProtKB:Q9H3M7)** - Thioredoxin-interacting protein functions as an enzyme inhibitor in response to oxidative stress.\n",
      "2. **ITCH (UniProtKB:Q96J02)** - E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that catalyzes ubiquitination of multiple proteins.\n",
      "3. **UBR5 (UniProtKB:O95071)** - E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that typically functions in branch-linked ubiquitination.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pathway Description:\n",
      "The model represents how ITCH and UBR5 work together to create branched-linked polyubiquitin chains on TXNIP, leading to its proteasomal degradation. ITCH creates initial 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains on TXNIP, which are then modified by UBR5 to create 'Lys-48'/'Lys-63' branched chains that target TXNIP for degradation by the proteasome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Support:\n",
      "The model is supported by direct experimental evidence from [PMID:29378950](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29378950/) which demonstrates that K63-linked polyubiquitination by ITCH triggers proteasome-mediated degradation of TXNIP through subsequent assembly of K48/K63 branched ubiquitin chains. TXNIP's cellular localization is supported by [PMID:14632196](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14632196/). TXNIP's role in response to oxidative stress is based on evidence from [PMID:17603038](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17603038/).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Structure:\n",
      "The model includes three activities:\n",
      "1. TXNIP's enzyme inhibitor activity (GO:0004857) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "2. ITCH's ubiquitin-ubiquitin ligase activity (GO:0034450)\n",
      "3. UBR5's ubiquitin-ubiquitin ligase activity (GO:0034450)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships:\n",
      "- ITCH's ubiquitin-ubiquitin ligase activity provides input for (RO:0002413) UBR5's activity\n",
      "- UBR5's ubiquitin-ubiquitin ligase activity directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) TXNIP's enzyme inhibitor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Process Annotations:\n",
      "- TXNIP's activity is part of response to oxidative stress (GO:0006979)\n",
      "- Both ITCH and UBR5's activities are part of protein branched polyubiquitination (GO:0141198)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Critical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. The model accurately captures the cooperation between ITCH and UBR5 in forming branched ubiquitin chains on TXNIP.\n",
      "2. The causal relationships correctly represent the sequential action of ITCH providing substrate for UBR5, and the negative regulation of TXNIP's function.\n",
      "3. The use of evidence from direct experimental assays provides strong support for the model's assertions.\n",
      "4. The subcellular localization of TXNIP in the cytoplasm is properly annotated.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues:\n",
      "1. **Redundant Causal Association**: There are duplicate causal associations between ITCH and UBR5. The model shows two identical \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) relationships from ITCH to UBR5, which is redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Proteasome Process**: While the model captures the branched polyubiquitination, it doesn't explicitly include the proteasomal degradation process that follows. Since the title references proteasomal degradation and the paper clearly shows this outcome, including GO:0043161 (proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process) would improve completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ubiquitination Chain Specificity**: The model doesn't specify the types of ubiquitin chains involved (K48/K63 branched chains), which is a key aspect of the biological mechanism described in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Remove one of the duplicate causal associations between ITCH and UBR5.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider adding an additional process annotation for proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161) to better represent the ultimate fate of TXNIP.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If possible within the GO-CAM framework, consider specifying the ubiquitin chain types involved (K48/K63 branched chains) to better capture the mechanism's specificity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion:\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that represents the current understanding of how ITCH and UBR5 cooperate to regulate TXNIP through branched polyubiquitination. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing complex molecular interactions. With minor adjustments to address the duplicate causal association and possibly include the downstream degradation process, it would be an even more comprehensive representation of this biological pathway.\n",

      "## Model Title\n",
      "\"Activation of the integrated stress response via activation of EIF2AK1/HRI by DELE1 in response to mitochondrial stress (Human)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the molecular pathway that relays mitochondrial stress to the cytosol, activating the integrated stress response (ISR) through the OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway in human cells. The model focuses on how mitochondrial stress triggers a signaling cascade that leads to phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and subsequent induction of downstream transcription factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the following key components and relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial stress response**: OMA1 (Q96E52) metalloendopeptidase activity in the mitochondrial intermembrane space\n",
      "2. **Signal relay**: DELE1 (Q14154) protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity in the cytosol\n",
      "3. **Stress kinase**: EIF2AK1/HRI (Q9BQI3) eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity in the cytosol\n",
      "4. **Downstream effects**: EIF2S1 (P05198) translation initiation factor activity and the activation of transcription factors ATF4 (P18848) and DDIT3 (P35638)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately reflects the current scientific understanding of the OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway as described in the key references (PMID:32132706 and PMID:32132707). The model captures how:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Mitochondrial stress activates the OMA1 protease, which cleaves DELE1\n",
      "2. Cleaved DELE1 accumulates in the cytosol where it interacts with HRI\n",
      "3. Activated HRI phosphorylates eIF2alpha (EIF2S1)\n",
      "4. Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha reduces global protein synthesis but increases translation of specific mRNAs, including ATF4\n",
      "5. ATF4 drives the transcription of stress-response genes including DDIT3/CHOP\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are associated with the correct cellular compartments, with OMA1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and HRI, DELE1, and eIF2alpha in the cytosol as described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Proper Use of Causal Relations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses the following causal relations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. OMA1 metalloendopeptidase activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) DELE1 kinase activator activity\n",
      "2. DELE1 kinase activator activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) EIF2AK1/HRI kinase activity\n",
      "3. EIF2AK1/HRI kinase activity both:\n",
      "   - Directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) EIF2S1 translation initiation factor activity\n",
      "   - Directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) EIF2S1 translation initiation factor activity\n",
      "4. EIF2S1 translation initiation factor activity provides input for (RO:0002407) both ATF4 and DDIT3 transcription factor activities\n",
      "\n",
      "These causal relations accurately represent the biology described in the literature, particularly how:\n",
      "- OMA1 activation leads to DELE1 cleavage and its accumulation in the cytosol\n",
      "- Cleaved DELE1 interacts with and activates HRI\n",
      "- HRI phosphorylates eIF2alpha, which has dual effects on translation (general inhibition but increased for specific mRNAs)\n",
      "- This leads to increased translation of ATF4 and DDIT3/CHOP\n",
      "\n",
      "## Completeness of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively captures the core OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway as described in the literature. It includes all the major players and their interactions in the integrated stress response triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction.\n",
      "\n",
      "One aspect that could potentially be expanded in future iterations is the inclusion of:\n",
      "1. The specific mitochondrial stressors that initially activate OMA1 (such as CCCP mentioned in the references)\n",
      "2. The specific phosphorylation sites on eIF2alpha (Ser51)\n",
      "3. The downstream transcriptional targets of ATF4 and DDIT3\n",
      "4. The feedback mechanisms that eventually attenuate the integrated stress response\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This model titled \"Retinoic acid binds and activates RARA and RXRA nuclear receptors (Human)\" represents the retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway in humans. It illustrates how retinoic acid activates the nuclear receptors RARA (Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha) and RXRA (Retinoid X Receptor Alpha), and their regulatory relationship with NCOA3 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "### Activities and Entities\n",
      "The model includes three key proteins:\n",
      "1. **RARA** (UniProtKB:P10276) - Performs nuclear receptor activity (GO:0004879)\n",
      "2. **RXRA** (UniProtKB:P19793) - Performs nuclear receptor activity (GO:0004879) \n",
      "3. **NCOA3** (UniProtKB:Q9Y6Q9) - Performs nuclear receptor coactivator activity (GO:0030374)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Location\n",
      "All activities occur in chromatin (GO:0000785), which is appropriate for nuclear receptor functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Process\n",
      "All activities are part of the retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway (GO:0048384), which is consistent with the model's purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "The model includes appropriate causal associations:\n",
      "1. RARA directly positively regulates RXRA (RO:0002629)\n",
      "2. RARA directly positively regulates NCOA3 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "3. RXRA directly positively regulates RARA (RO:0002629)\n",
      "4. RXRA directly positively regulates NCOA3 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "\n",
      "This creates a feedback loop between RARA and RXRA, which is consistent with the biology of these nuclear receptors often functioning as heterodimers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes with relevant literature citations:\n",
      "- Evidence code ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) is used throughout\n",
      "- Key references include PMID:2825025, PMID:9267036, and PMID:19917671\n",
      "- All assertions are supported by publications describing retinoic acid receptor signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conformance to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "### Complex Representation\n",
      "The model does not explicitly represent the RARA-RXRA heterodimer as a complex entity. Based on the GO-CAM documentation \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM,\" this approach is valid since both RARA and RXRA have defined activities, and their causal relationships appropriately reflect their functional interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "The causal relationships are correctly modeled using the appropriate relation RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates), which is the correct relation for this type of regulatory relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Completeness\n",
      "The model provides a focused representation of retinoic acid receptor signaling through RARA and RXRA. The inclusion of the coactivator NCOA3 adds important regulatory context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "The model is scientifically accurate and consistent with the current understanding of retinoic acid signaling:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. RARA and RXRA act as nuclear receptors that can form heterodimers\n",
      "2. NCOA3 functions as a coactivator for these nuclear receptors\n",
      "3. The reciprocal positive regulation between RARA and RXRA is well-documented\n",
      "4. The activation of NCOA3 by both receptors is consistent with its coactivator function\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence from UniProt entries confirms:\n",
      "- RARA binds to RXRA to form heterodimers\n",
      "- Nuclear receptor activity is enhanced by coactivators like NCOA3\n",
      "- Retinoic acid binding induces conformational changes in these receptors leading to transcriptional activation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is scientifically sound, there are a few potential improvements that could enhance the representation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consider including retinoic acid as a chemical entity** - The model title refers to retinoic acid, but the molecule itself (CHEBI:35291) is only listed as an object, not integrated into the model as a binding partner for the receptors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Target genes** - Consider expanding the model to include downstream transcriptional targets regulated by the RARA-RXRA complex, which would provide a more complete picture of the pathway's functional outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Alternative receptor states** - The model could potentially indicate the different states of the receptors (ligand-bound vs. unbound), as these states influence their interactions with coactivators and corepressors.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:6606056e00001308) provides a clear and accurate representation of retinoic acid receptor signaling involving RARA, RXRA, and NCOA3.

      "\n",
      "**Status:** Production\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the mechanism of amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance involving the interaction between clusterin (CLU), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), and DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (TYROBP/DAP12). This pathway plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains four key activities:\n",

      "\n",
      "All activities are part of the biological process \"amyloid-beta clearance\" (GO:0097242).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts the following causal chain:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. CLU (Clusterin) directly positively regulates TREM2 receptor activity\n",
      "2. TREM2 directly positively regulates TYROBP/DAP12 adaptor activity\n",
      "3. TYROBP/DAP12 directly positively regulates SYK kinase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "This signaling cascade represents how extracellular CLU interacts with the TREM2 receptor on microglia, leading to activation of the TYROBP/DAP12 adaptor protein and subsequent activation of the SYK kinase, ultimately resulting in amyloid-beta clearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Accuracy and Correctness\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis of the provided literature and molecular data, this model accurately represents the current understanding of the CLU-TREM2-TYROBP-SYK pathway in amyloid-beta clearance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Scientific Accuracy**: The model is backed by scientific evidence from multiple papers, including:\n",
      "   - The interaction between CLU and TREM2 (PMID:27477018)\n",
      "   - The role of TREM2 as a receptor for amyloid-beta (PMID:29518356)\n",
      "   - The interaction between TREM2 and DAP12/TYROBP (PMID:23459077)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Localization**: The model correctly represents:\n",
      "   - CLU as a secreted protein acting in the extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "   - TREM2 as a plasma membrane receptor (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - TYROBP/DAP12 as a plasma membrane-associated adaptor (GO:0005886)\n",

      "   - TREM2 as a transmembrane signaling receptor\n",
      "   - TYROBP as a protein-macromolecule adaptor\n",
      "   - SYK as a protein tyrosine kinase\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Completeness\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents a focused view of the CLU-TREM2-TYROBP-SYK pathway for amyloid-beta clearance. While concise, the model could be expanded to include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Downstream effects of SYK activation**: The model doesn't specify how SYK activation leads to amyloid-beta clearance. SYK phosphorylates multiple downstream targets that lead to phagocytosis and degradation of amyloid-beta.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Alternative pathways**: The TREM2 receptor can bind multiple ligands beyond CLU, including amyloid-beta itself and ApoE. These alternative interactions could be represented in relation to this pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The use of \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) is appropriate for the direct activation relationships between these components.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enabled by annotations**: Each activity is properly enabled by the corresponding gene product.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular location annotations**: Each activity has appropriate cellular component annotations.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **More specific biological context**: While the model mentions amyloid-beta clearance, it could specify the cell types (e.g., microglia) and pathological contexts (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) more explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Extended downstream effects**: Including downstream effects of SYK activation would make the model more comprehensive, showing how this pathway leads to phagocytosis and degradation of amyloid-beta.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Related molecular mechanisms**: The model could integrate related pathways known to interact with this mechanism, such as toll-like receptor signaling, which has cross-talk with TREM2 signaling.\n",

      "\n",
      "The model [**gomodel:6606056e00001462**](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6606056e00001462) entitled \"TREM2 activated by APOA1. (Human)\" represents a signaling pathway in which APOA1 (Apolipoprotein A-I) activates TREM2 (Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2), which then triggers a signaling cascade involving TYROBP/DAP12 (TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding protein) and leading to SYK (Spleen tyrosine kinase) activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Biological Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains four connected molecular activities that form a clear signaling pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **APOA1 (UniProtKB:P02647)** performs receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018) in the extracellular space (GO:0005615), which is part of the cellular response to lipoprotein particle stimulus (GO:0071402)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **TREM2 (UniProtKB:Q9NZC2)** performs transmembrane signaling receptor activity (GO:0004888) at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), also part of the cellular response to lipoprotein particle stimulus (GO:0071402)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **TYROBP/DAP12 (UniProtKB:O43914)** performs protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674) at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), as part of the cellular response to amyloid-beta (GO:1904646)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **SYK (UniProtKB:P43405)** performs protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713) in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737), also as part of the cellular response to amyloid-beta (GO:1904646)\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal connections in the model use appropriate relationship predicates:\n",
      "- APOA1 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) TREM2\n",
      "- TREM2 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) TYROBP\n",
      "- TYROBP directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) SYK\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model correctly represents the TREM2-TYROBP-SYK signaling axis, which is well-established in the literature. TREM2 is known to signal via its adaptor protein TYROBP/DAP12 which then activates SYK kinase.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Appropriate GO terms are used for molecular functions, cellular locations, and biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The model includes proper evidence codes and literature references for each assertion. Most activities and relationships are supported by direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The addition of APOA1 as an activator of TREM2 is supported by the cited literature (PMID:27477018), which describes TREM2 binding to apolipoproteins including APOA1.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The model correctly indicates the cellular locations of each protein (extracellular space for APOA1, plasma membrane for TREM2 and TYROBP, and cytoplasm for SYK).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological Process Consistency**: While APOA1 and TREM2 are annotated to \"cellular response to lipoprotein particle stimulus\" (GO:0071402), TYROBP and SYK are annotated to \"cellular response to amyloid-beta\" (GO:1904646). This creates an inconsistency in the biological process representation. Since this appears to be modeling APOA1-induced TREM2 signaling (not amyloid-beta), I would recommend consistently using GO:0071402 across all molecules in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Mechanistic Details**: The model doesn't capture the phosphorylation events that are critical for this signaling cascade. According to UniProt data, TYROBP contains ITAM domains that get phosphorylated and then recruit SYK via its SH2 domains. These mechanistic details would enhance the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Codes**: For SYK, the evidence code is \"sequence similarity evidence used in manual assertion\" (ECO:0000250) with \"UniProtKB:P48025\" in the with_objects field, indicating that this is inferred from sequence similarity to mouse. Given the importance of SYK in human myeloid cells, stronger experimental evidence specific to human SYK would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing Context**: The biological context in which this pathway operates (e.g., microglia, monocytes, macrophages) is not explicitly captured in the model. TREM2 is particularly important in microglia in the brain, but this contextual information is missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Relationship to Alzheimer's Disease**: Given that TREM2 variants are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and APOA1 is involved in lipid metabolism, the model could potentially benefit from linking to Alzheimer's disease-related processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consistent Biological Process**: Annotate all activities to the same biological process, either \"cellular response to lipoprotein particle stimulus\" or use a more specific term that appropriately captures the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Phosphorylation Details**: Include the phosphorylation of TYROBP's ITAM domain as a key regulatory step in the activation of SYK.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Stronger Evidence for SYK**: Replace the sequence similarity evidence for SYK with direct experimental evidence from human cells if available.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Cell Type Context**: Include annotation to indicate the cell type(s) in which this pathway operates, particularly microglia if that's the intended context.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider Expanding the Model**: The model could be expanded to include downstream targets of SYK, such as PLCγ2, PI3K, or other signaling molecules that TREM2 activation ultimately influences.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Link to Disease Relevance**: Consider adding annotations or notes about the relevance of this pathway to Alzheimer's disease, given the genetic association of TREM2 variants with AD risk.\n",

      "## Overview of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This model is titled \"TREM2 activated by APOA2. (Human)\" and describes an important signaling pathway in human microglia that is relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. It represents how Apolipoprotein A-II (APOA2) activates the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which leads to downstream signaling through the TYROBP/DAP12 adaptor protein and SYK kinase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains four key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **APOA2 (P02652)** - Receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018) occurring in extracellular space\n",
      "2. **TREM2 (Q9NZC2)** - Transmembrane signaling receptor activity (GO:0004888) occurring in plasma membrane\n",
      "3. **TYROBP/DAP12 (O43914)** - Protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674) occurring in plasma membrane\n",
      "4. **SYK (P43405)** - Protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713) occurring in cytoplasm\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes causal relationships that describe the following pathway:\n",
      "- APOA2 ligand (GO:0048018) → directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) → TREM2 receptor (GO:0004888)\n",
      "- TREM2 receptor (GO:0004888) → directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) → TYROBP adaptor (GO:0030674)\n",
      "- TYROBP adaptor (GO:0030674) → directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) → SYK kinase (GO:0004713)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context\n",
      "\n",
      "The activities are placed in the context of two biological processes:\n",
      "- Cellular response to lipoprotein particle stimulus (GO:0071402)\n",
      "- Cellular response to amyloid-beta (GO:1904646)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and Provenance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses high-quality evidence from experimental studies:\n",
      "- Direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) from published literature (PMID:27477018, PMID:23459077, PMID:29518356)\n",
      "- Sequence similarity evidence (ECO:0000250) for some aspects (particularly SYK activity)\n",
      "- Annotations are from the contributor with ORCID 0000-0001-8769-177X, dated April 4, 2024\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Accuracy and Biological Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents a signaling pathway that has been well-documented in the literature. Based on the PMID:29518356 (\"TREM2 is a receptor for beta-amyloid which mediates microglial function\"), TREM2 has been shown to bind to APOA2 and other apolipoproteins to facilitate uptake of amyloid-beta by microglia. This paper specifically demonstrates:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TREM2 binds to apolipoproteins including APOA2\n",
      "2. This binding enhances TREM2 interaction with DAP12 (TYROBP)\n",
      "3. This leads to downstream phosphorylation of SYK\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents these relationships with appropriate GO terms and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes and signaling pathways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Representation of activities**: Each protein is appropriately annotated with a specific molecular function that it performs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The model uses correct causal relationship predicates (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\") to connect the activities in a directional manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular contexts**: Each activity is appropriately annotated with a cellular component to indicate where it occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological processes**: The activities are connected to relevant biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence**: Each assertion is supported by appropriate evidence codes and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Complex representation**: The model correctly follows the recommendations for annotating activities in the context of complexes. Since the specific molecular functions carried out by each component (TREM2, TYROBP, SYK) are known, they are individually represented rather than using a complex GO term, which aligns with guideline #1 from the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I would suggest a few potential enhancements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional molecular context**: The model could potentially be expanded to include the known binding of amyloid-beta to TREM2, which is a key aspect described in PMID:29518356. This would provide more complete molecular context for the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Downstream effects**: The model could be extended to include downstream effects of SYK activation, such as phosphorylation of specific targets or activation of specific pathways that lead to microglial activation, which are mentioned in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional processes**: The model could be connected to additional relevant biological processes such as phagocytosis or inflammatory response, which are known outcomes of this signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:6606056e00001507 accurately represents the signaling pathway where APOA2 activates TREM2, leading to signaling through TYROBP and SYK in human cells. It adheres to GO-CAM best practices and is supported by high-quality experimental evidence.

      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four key molecular activities connected in a causal pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ATE1 (O95260)** - Arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase activity (GO:0004057)\n",
      "   - Occurs in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - Part of ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0006511)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **KCMF1 (Q9P0J7)** - E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **UBR4 (Q5T4S7)** - E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "   - Occurs in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - Part of protein K27-linked ubiquitination (GO:0044314)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **SQSTM1/p62 (Q13501)** - Protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674)\n",

      "1. ATE1 *provides input for* (RO:0002413) KCMF1\n",
      "2. KCMF1 *provides input for* (RO:0002413) UBR4\n",
      "3. UBR4 *provides input for* (RO:0002413) SQSTM1\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Validation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with the recent literature, especially PMID:34893540 (Heo et al., 2021) which describes the N-terminal cysteine as a dual sensor of oxygen and oxidative stress. This paper indicates that ATE1 arginylates proteins with oxidized N-terminal cysteines, creating a target for ubiquitination by E3 ligases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper specifically describes UBR4 and KCMF1 working together to assemble heterotypic 'Lys-63'-/'Lys-27'-linked branched ubiquitin chains on oxidized proteins, leading to their degradation by autophagy, which is consistent with the GO-CAM model.\n",
      "\n",
      "SQSTM1 (p62) is accurately represented as the adaptor protein that targets ubiquitinated proteins to autophagosomes, as confirmed by PMID:22948227.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Correctness\n",
      "\n",
      "The model properly follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The activities are properly connected using the correct causal relation (RO:0002413 - *provides input for*)\n",
      "2. Each protein's activity is correctly annotated with the appropriate molecular function\n",
      "3. The cellular locations of each activity are properly specified\n",
      "4. The broader biological processes are correctly associated with each activity\n",

      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is fundamentally sound, there are a few potential enhancements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **More Specific Causal Relationships**: The model uses \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) for all relationships. In some cases, more specific causal relations could be used, particularly between the E3 ligases (KCMF1 and UBR4) where \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) might be more precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Elaboration of Oxidative Stress Trigger**: The model could benefit from including the oxidative stress trigger that initiates this pathway, perhaps representing it as an environmental condition or including the oxidation of N-terminal cysteines as an explicit part of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inclusion of Autophagosome-Lysosome Fusion**: The model currently ends at targeting to autophagosomes. It might be valuable to extend it to include the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and subsequent degradation of the ubiquitinated proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:6606056e00001745) is a high-quality representation of the biological process where UBR4 and KCMF1 ubiquitinate arginylated proteins in response to oxidative stress, leading to their degradation in autophagosomes. The model is consistent with the current literature, particularly the recent publication by Heo et al. (2021), and follows GO-CAM best practices.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Major Components of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four key proteins in this pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **OMA1 ([Q96E52](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q96E52))**: A mitochondrial metalloendopeptidase\n",

      "1. OMA1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space has metalloendopeptidase activity in response to cellular stress\n",
      "2. OMA1 cleaves DELE1, which then accumulates in the cytosol\n",
      "3. The cleaved DELE1 activates EIF2AK1/HRI (protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity)\n",
      "4. EIF2AK1/HRI phosphorylates EIF2S1, promoting its localization to mitochondria\n",
      "5. This ultimately leads to mitophagy\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of this recently discovered pathway. The pathway was first characterized in 2020 papers (PMID:32132706 and PMID:32132707) and further studied in a 2024 paper (PMID:38340717) that specifically linked it to mitophagy.\n",

      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correctly annotating molecular functions**: Each protein is assigned appropriate molecular functions (OMA1 - metalloendopeptidase activity, DELE1 - protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity, EIF2AK1 - eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correctly specifying cellular components**: Each activity is associated with its correct cellular location (OMA1 - mitochondrial intermembrane space, DELE1 - cytosol, HRI - cytosol)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Using appropriate causal relationships**: \n",
      "   - OMA1 directly positively regulates DELE1 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "   - DELE1 directly positively regulates EIF2AK1/HRI (RO:0002629)\n",
      "   - EIF2AK1/HRI directly negatively regulates EIF2S1 (RO:0002630)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Linking to appropriate biological processes**: Each activity is correctly associated with relevant biological processes\n",
      "   - OMA1 is part of \"cellular response to stress\" (GO:0033554)\n",
      "   - DELE1 and EIF2AK1 are part of \"HRI-mediated signaling\" (GO:0140468)\n",

      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-constructed and represents the pathway accurately. A few minor points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular function of EIF2S1**: Currently has \"molecular_function\" (GO:0003674), which is a placeholder term. Based on the UniProt entry, it could be more specific, possibly annotating it with \"translation initiation factor activity\" (GO:0003743).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Representation of OMA1 activation**: The model doesn't explicitly represent what activates OMA1 (mitochondrial stress or damage). Adding this upstream cause would more completely represent the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Potential for adding more detailed pathway outcomes**: The model connects to mitophagy but could potentially elaborate more on the downstream effects of this pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model ([gomodel:6606056e00002011](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6606056e00002011)) represents the interactions between CD72 and the B cell receptor (BCR) complex during co-stimulation with the sn/RNP self antigen in human cells. The model includes four key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. B cell receptor (BCR) complex (CD79A/CD79B) transmembrane signaling receptor activity\n",
      "2. LYN protein tyrosine kinase activity \n",
      "3. CD72 transmembrane signaling receptor activity\n",
      "4. PTPN6/SHP-1 protein tyrosine phosphatase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate representation of the BCR complex**: The model correctly represents the BCR complex as a protein complex consisting of CD79A and CD79B. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guide, when multiple proteins form a complex with shared activity, using a complex representation is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct signaling pathway relationships**: The model properly uses causal relationships (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\") to connect the activities in the signaling pathway, following the chain from BCR to LYN to CD72 to PTPN6.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct cellular localization**: All activities are properly annotated with their cellular locations - the receptor activities occurring at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886) and PTPN6 in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate biological processes**: Each activity is correctly associated with relevant biological processes - BCR complex with BCR signaling pathway (GO:0050853), LYN with B cell homeostasis (GO:0001782), CD72 with negative regulation of BCR signaling (GO:0050859), and PTPN6 also with negative regulation of BCR signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence support**: The model includes appropriate evidence codes and references for the assertions, primarily using experimental evidence from relevant publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement/Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Self-antigen representation**: The model does not explicitly show how the sn/RNP self-antigen initiates the signaling pathway. According to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\", there are specific ways to represent how ligands interact with receptors. Although sn/RNP is not a protein ligand (it's a nucleoprotein complex), it would be helpful to include it in the model to show the complete picture of how CD72 and BCR are co-stimulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pathway completeness**: The molecular functions between LYN kinase activity and CD72 receptor activity could be more explicitly detailed. The model shows LYN directly regulating CD72, but it would be valuable to include any intermediate steps if they are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence consistency**: While the model does include evidence codes and references, some activities use sequence similarity evidence (ECO:0000250) with references to mouse (MGI) rather than direct experimental evidence in humans. Where possible, human-specific experimental evidence would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional downstream effects**: If known, it would be beneficial to include additional downstream effects of PTPN6/SHP-1 phosphatase activity, particularly how it ultimately impacts B cell function or fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my review of the literature provided and the model content:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **BCR Complex**: The model correctly represents the BCR complex as consisting of membrane immunoglobulin associated with CD79A/CD79B heterodimers, which is consistent with current understanding of BCR structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **CD72 function**: The model accurately depicts CD72 as a negative regulator of BCR signaling, which aligns with the literature showing that CD72 negatively regulates B cell responses to sn/RNP via recruitment of SHP-1/PTPN6.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **LYN kinase role**: The model appropriately places LYN kinase as an early component of BCR signaling, which is supported by the literature describing LYN as one of the first kinases activated following BCR engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Negative regulation pathway**: The pathway from CD72 to PTPN6/SHP-1 is accurate, as the literature confirms that CD72 recruits the phosphatase SHP-1 to negatively regulate BCR signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Spatial organization**: The cellular locations of the activities are scientifically accurate, with receptors at the plasma membrane and downstream signaling components in the cytoplasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Comparison to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: The model correctly uses a protein complex association to represent the BCR complex, following the guidelines in the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Signaling relationships**: The causal relationships between activities follow the guidelines for representing signaling pathways, using \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Contextual annotations**: Each activity has appropriate contextual annotations (cellular component and biological process), following GO-CAM standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence codes**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes, although more direct experimental evidence rather than sequence similarity would be preferred where available.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:6606056e00002011) provides a scientifically accurate representation of CD72 and BCR co-stimulation by sn/RNP self-antigen in humans. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes and signaling pathways, with appropriate contextual annotations and evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be enhanced by explicitly representing the sn/RNP self-antigen and its interaction with both CD72 and the BCR, as well as by including additional downstream effects of PTPN6/SHP-1 activity if known. Additionally, using human-specific experimental evidence rather than evidence inferred from mouse would strengthen the model where possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents key aspects of the CD72 and BCR co-stimulation pathway and its negative regulation in human B cells.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Taxon**: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Status**: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Description\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the mechanism by which HIV-1 Vif protein counteracts the host antiviral defense protein APOBEC3G by hijacking a host cullin-5-RING E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex. The pathway involves neddylation, ubiquitination, and ultimately leads to the degradation of APOBEC3G, which prevents its antiviral cytidine deaminase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of how HIV-1 Vif counteracts host APOBEC3G:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **HIV-1 Vif** (P69723) acts as a ubiquitin ligase-substrate adaptor, correctly annotated with GO:1990756.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **APOBEC3G** (Q9HC16) is shown with its cytidine deaminase activity (GO:0004126), which is critical for its antiviral function.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The model includes the key components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex:\n",
      "   - CUL5 (Q93034) with ubiquitin ligase complex scaffold activity (GO:0160072)\n",
      "   - RNF7/RBX2 (Q9UBF6) with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "   - UBE2F (Q969M7) with NEDD8 conjugating enzyme activity (GO:0061654)\n",
      "   - ARIH2 (O95376) with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The causal relationships between activities follow the expected pathway for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation:\n",
      "   - UBE2F neddylation → RNF7 NEDD8 ligase activity → ARIH2 ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "   - HIV-1 Vif adaptor activity → RNF7 ubiquitin ligase activity → Negative regulation of APOBEC3G\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the mechanism described in the literature, particularly from the key reference (PMID:22190037).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The appropriate \"part_of\" biological process annotations are used, including:\n",
      "   - Protein neddylation (GO:0045116)\n",
      "   - Proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161)\n",
      "   - Innate immune response (GO:0045087)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The causal relationships use appropriate predicates, following the pattern described in the E3 ubiquitin ligases documentation:\n",
      "   - RO:0002413 (provides input for)\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates)\n",
      "   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Issues and Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cellular location**: The model includes \"host cell cytoplasm\" (GO:0030430) for HIV-1 Vif, which is correct. However, for completeness, the location of APOBEC3G could be added, as it's known to localize primarily in the cytoplasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional biological process**: APOBEC3G could also be annotated as part of \"defense response to virus\" (GO:0051607) in addition to \"innate immune response\" (GO:0045087), to better highlight its specific role in viral defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Model completeness**: While the main pathway is well-represented, including the CBF-beta (CBFB) component, which is hijacked by Vif and is critical for the formation of the functional E3 ligase complex as described in PMID:22190037, would enhance the model's completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows the GO-CAM best practices for representing E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: The model correctly represents individual components of the E3 ligase complex with their specific activities rather than using a general complex term.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **E3 ligase annotation**: The components follow the pattern described in the E3 ubiquitin ligases documentation, with the scaffold (CUL5), the adaptor (HIV-1 Vif), and the ligase components (RNF7, ARIH2) properly connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**: The model uses the recommended predicates for causal relationships between activities.\n",

      "## Summary of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This model ([gomodel:66187e4700000246](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:66187e4700000246)) describes \"The CRL5(ASB9) complex mediates ubiquitination and degradation of CKB (Human).\" It represents a specific biochemical pathway where the CRL5(ASB9) E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex targets creatine kinase B-type (CKB) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows several key activities connected through causal relationships:\n",
      "1. CKB ([UniProtKB:P12277](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:P12277)) performing creatine kinase activity (GO:0004111) as part of phosphocreatine biosynthetic process (GO:0046314)\n",
      "2. CUL5 ([UniProtKB:Q93034](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q93034)) performing ubiquitin ligase complex scaffold activity (GO:0160072) as part of proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161)\n",
      "3. ASB9 ([UniProtKB:Q96DX5](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q96DX5)) performing ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity (GO:1990756) as part of proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161)\n",
      "4. RNF7 ([UniProtKB:Q9UBF6](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q9UBF6)) performing ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) as part of proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161)\n",
      "5. RNF7 also performing NEDD8 ligase activity (GO:0061663) as part of protein neddylation (GO:0045116)\n",

      "\n",
      "The causal connections show:\n",
      "- CUL5 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) ASB9's adaptor activity\n",

      "\n",
      "## Evidence and Literature Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by evidence from multiple publications:\n",
      "- The creatine kinase activity of CKB is supported by [PMID:8186255](https://bioregistry.io/pmid:8186255), which established the catalytic site of creatine kinase through site-directed mutagenesis.\n",
      "- The ubiquitination mechanisms and complex interactions are supported by [PMID:33268465](https://bioregistry.io/pmid:33268465), which provides detailed mechanistic insight into how NEDD8 activation of CUL5 ubiquitin E3 ligases works, particularly focusing on the ASB9-CRL E3 ligase complex and its targeting of CKB.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy and Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the molecular mechanism discovered in the literature. It correctly shows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The CRL5(ASB9) complex consisting of:\n",
      "   - CUL5 as the scaffold\n",
      "   - ASB9 as the substrate recognition component\n",
      "   - RNF7 (also known as RBX2 or SAG) as the RING component\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The regulatory mechanism where:\n",
      "   - RNF7 performs protein neddylation, which is a prerequisite for the complex's activity\n",
      "   - ASB9 recognizes and binds to the substrate (CKB)\n",
      "   - ARIH2 works with the CRL5 complex to catalyze the ubiquitination of CKB\n",
      "   - Ubiquitination of CKB leads to its degradation, effectively negatively regulating its activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The model correctly depicts that ARIH2 is essential for the complex to effectively ubiquitinate CKB, as shown in the literature. PMID:33268465 specifically demonstrates that ARIH2 is required for efficient ubiquitination of CKB by the ASB9-CRL complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Alignment with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes, as outlined in the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The activities are attributed to the specific proteins that carry them (option 1 in the guidelines), rather than to the complex as a whole, which is appropriate since the roles of the individual components are well-characterized.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The scaffold activity of CUL5 is represented first, properly activating subsequent activities from other components of the complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The causal connections follow the standard predicates correctly:\n",
      "   - \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) is used properly to show activation relationships\n",
      "   - \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) is used properly to show sequential process connections\n",
      "   - \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630) is used properly to show the inhibitory effect of ubiquitination on CKB\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Potential Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional Molecular Details**: The model could potentially be expanded to include the specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes that work with this E3 ligase complex. The literature mentions UBE2L3 and other E2s that can contribute to polyubiquitination.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ubiquitination Sites**: The model could potentially annotate the specific lysine residues on CKB that are targeted for ubiquitination (K45, K101, K107, and K381) as identified in PMID:33268465.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **ELOB/ELOC Components**: The literature describes elongin B and elongin C (ELOB/C) as components of the CRL5 complex, but these are not represented in the current model. Adding these components could provide a more complete picture of the complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Neddylation Details**: While the model includes the neddylation activity, it could potentially specify that CUL5 is neddylated at K724, which is important for the recruitment of ARIH2 (as described in PMID:33268465).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of how the CRL5(ASB9) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets CKB for degradation. The model effectively captures the key proteins, activities, and causal relationships involved in this process, with strong literature support for all assertions. It follows GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes and their activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model provides a valuable contribution to the GO-CAM knowledge base by representing a specific example of selective protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is a fundamental cellular process with implications for numerous biological functions and disease mechanisms.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model depicts the ubiquitination and degradation of BIK (Bcl-2-interacting killer) protein mediated by the CRL5(ASB11) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The model shows the transcriptional induction of ASB11 by XBP1s during the adaptive phase of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and how this leads to BIK ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context\n",
      "The model represents a mechanism for regulating cell survival during ER stress. BIK is a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein that can trigger cell death. During the adaptive phase of the UPR, cells attempt to restore ER homeostasis rather than undergo apoptosis. The CRL5(ASB11) complex provides a mechanism to degrade BIK, thus promoting cell survival during this adaptive phase.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Accuracy Review\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular activities**: The model correctly assigns molecular functions to each protein based on the literature:\n",
      "   - XBP1s as a transcription factor\n",
      "   - ASB11 as an adaptor protein for substrate recognition\n",
      "   - RNF7 as the ubiquitin ligase\n",
      "   - CUL5 as the scaffold protein\n",
      "   - VCP/p97 as the recognition component for ubiquitinated proteins\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-supported by literature**: The model is extensively supported by the primary literature, particularly the key paper by Chen et al. (2019), which demonstrates ASB11's role in BIK ubiquitination.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correctly represents ER stress response**: The model accurately shows how ER stress leads to XBP1 activation, which then upregulates ASB11 expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper causal relationships**: The causal relationships between activities follow the correct biological sequence:\n",
      "   - XBP1s activates ASB11 expression\n",
      "   - ASB11 directly positively regulates RNF7\n",
      "   - RNF7 provides input for VCP/p97\n",
      "   - VCP/p97 provides input for proteasomal degradation\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Correct cellular locations**: The subcellular locations (nucleus, ER, cytoplasm) are correctly assigned to each protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing complex representation**: The model represents the CRL5(ASB11) complex as individual components rather than using a complex ID. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, if the specific activity of each subunit is known (which is the case here), this approach is acceptable. However, it might be clearer to also include the full complex representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete BIK activity representation**: BIK itself is not represented as a node in the model. While the focus is on its degradation, representing BIK's pro-apoptotic activity would provide more complete biological context about why its degradation is important for cell survival during ER stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing regulation by DERL1**: According to the literature (Chen et al. 2019), DERL1 plays a role in this pathway by interacting with BIK to facilitate its degradation. This interaction is not represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Incomplete representation of timing**: The model doesn't fully capture the temporal aspect of the pathway - specifically that ASB11-mediated BIK degradation is transient and occurs primarily during the adaptive phase of UPR.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Missing K48 polyubiquitination specificity**: The model doesn't specify that the ubiquitination of BIK involves K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which is important for proteasomal targeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence used in the model is strong and well-documented:\n",
      "- All activities are supported by experimental evidence (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- Primary literature references are provided, including PMID:31387940 (the key paper on this pathway), PMID:29033132, and others\n",
      "- Each annotation has appropriate provenance information\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add BIK as a node**: Include BIK as a protein with its pro-apoptotic activity, and show how its degradation connects to cell survival outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expand on UPR context**: Add more context about how this mechanism fits into the broader unfolded protein response, particularly the transition from adaptive to apoptotic phases.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include DERL1**: Add DERL1 to the model and its interaction with BIK to complete the pathway representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add K48 ubiquitination specification**: Specify the K48 linkage type for the ubiquitination, as this is key for proteasomal degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider using a complex ID**: While the current representation with individual proteins is acceptable according to GO-CAM guidelines, also representing the CRL5(ASB11) complex as a whole might enhance clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the biological process of BIK ubiquitination and degradation mediated by the CRL5(ASB11) complex during ER stress. The model effectively captures the key molecular players and their causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with GO-CAM best practices and is well-supported by experimental evidence. With minor additions and clarifications as suggested above, it could provide an even more comprehensive representation of this important regulatory mechanism in the ER stress response.\n",

      "\n",
      "Title: \"N6-methyladenosine-modified lncRNA ARHGAP5-AS1 stabilises CSDE1 and coordinates oncogenic RNA regulons in hepatocellular carcinoma. PMID:36354136. (Human)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This model captures molecular mechanisms described in a publication about N6-methyladenosine modification of lncRNA ARHGAP5-AS1 and its role in stabilizing CSDE1 protein in hepatocellular carcinoma. The model describes how this pathway leads to ERK activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Components Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following key molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A methyl transferase complex (GO:0036396) carrying out m6A methylation of RNAs\n",
      "2. IGF2BP2 functioning as an m6A RNA reader protein\n",
      "3. The lncRNA ARHGAP5-AS1 interacting with CSDE1 protein\n",
      "4. TRIM28 acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for CSDE1\n",
      "5. CSDE1 binding mRNA and regulating translation\n",
      "6. MAPK3/ERK1 as a downstream effector\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. The model accurately captures the key molecular interactions described in the paper\n",
      "2. Appropriate molecular functions are assigned to each protein\n",
      "3. Causal relationships between activities are properly defined\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Protein Complex Representation Issue**:\n",
      "   - The model uses `GO:0036396` (RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase complex) but lists \"UniProtKB:Q86U44\" (METTL3) and \"UniProtKB:Q8N3J2\" (METTL14) as members. However, based on the paper, it's METTL14 that is specifically mentioned as the m6A writer for ARHGAP5-AS1.\n",
      "   - According to the annotation guidelines for complexes, when the specific subunit carrying out an activity is known, it's better to represent that specific protein rather than using the complex ID.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Since the paper identifies METTL14 as the primary m6A writer for ARHGAP5-AS1, consider representing METTL14 as the active enzyme rather than using the complex ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Causal Relationships**:\n",
      "   - The model shows that IGF2BP2's m6A reader activity directly positively regulates the protein binding activity of the lncRNA ARHGAP5-AS1, but there's a missing connection explaining how the m6A modification leads to stabilization of ARHGAP5-AS1.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Add an explicit connection showing that the m6A reader activity stabilizes the lncRNA, perhaps through an RNA stabilization process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ubiquitin Ligase Activity Representation**:\n",
      "   - The model correctly shows TRIM28 with ubiquitin ligase activity affecting CSDE1, but the biological process associated with this activity is \"proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process\" (GO:0043161). This is accurate but could be more specific.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Consider adding the more specific process \"negative regulation of proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process\" (GO:0032435) to better reflect ARHGAP5-AS1's inhibitory role.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pathway Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The model stops at MAPK3 activation but doesn't capture the downstream effects on VIM and RAC1 translation that are mentioned in the paper.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Consider extending the model to include these downstream effects to fully represent the pathway described in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence Codes**:\n",
      "   - Some of the evidence codes used are appropriate (ECO:0000315 for mutant phenotype evidence), but there could be more specific evidence codes used for some of the interactions.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Review evidence codes to ensure they most accurately reflect the experimental evidence in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conformance to GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ✓ Activities are properly connected with causal relationships\n",
      "2. ✓ Molecular functions are appropriately assigned to proteins\n",
      "3. ✓ Biological processes are correctly associated with activities\n",
      "4. ✓ Appropriate relationship types (RO terms) are used\n",
      "5. ✓ The model avoids circular reasoning or redundant connections\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the key findings from the paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ✓ m6A modification of ARHGAP5-AS1 by the methyltransferase complex\n",
      "2. ✓ IGF2BP2 acting as an m6A reader protein for ARHGAP5-AS1\n",
      "3. ✓ ARHGAP5-AS1 inhibiting TRIM28-mediated ubiquitination of CSDE1\n",
      "4. ✓ CSDE1 promoting mRNA translation\n",
      "5. ✓ Activation of the ERK pathway as a downstream effect\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately captures the molecular mechanisms described in the paper. The main recommendations for improvement are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider using METTL14 specifically instead of the complex ID since the paper identifies it as the primary m6A writer\n",
      "2. Add clearer connections showing how m6A modification leads to RNA stabilization\n",
      "3. Use more specific biological process terms for the TRIM28 activity\n",

      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "This model represents the RNA capping pathway in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* (fission yeast), specifically focusing on the 7-methylguanosine mRNA capping process (GO:0006370). The model includes four key activities performed by different proteins:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. mRNA 5'-triphosphate monophosphatase activity (Pct1)\n",
      "2. mRNA guanylyltransferase activity (Ceg1)\n",
      "3. mRNA 5'-cap (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase activity (Pcm1)\n",
      "4. RNA polymerase II CTD regulatory activities (Rpb1 and Mcs6)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the key components of the RNA capping pathway in fission yeast. In contrast to budding yeast (*S. cerevisiae*) where the capping machinery enzymes interact directly with each other, the literature confirms that *S. pombe* capping enzymes don't necessarily interact with each other but can independently interact with RNA polymerase II.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships between activities are supported by primary research literature, particularly:\n",
      "- The sequential process from Pct1 (triphosphatase) to Ceg1 (guanylyltransferase) to Pcm1 (methyltransferase)\n",
      "- The regulatory interactions of RNA Pol II (Rpb1) and the kinase Mcs6 in the process\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity representation**: Each molecular function is appropriately associated with the protein that performs it\n",
      "2. **Causal connections**: The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates: primarily RO:0002413 (provides input for) and RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates)\n",
      "3. **Evidence**: Each assertion is backed by appropriate evidence codes and PMIDs\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Subcellular localization**: The model includes cellular location information for some proteins (nucleus, P-TEFb-cap methyltransferase complex) but not all. This could be completed for the remaining proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence details**: Some of the PMIDs cited couldn't be retrieved in full, making it difficult to fully verify all supporting evidence. In particular, PMID:19328067 and PMID:11139608 couldn't be examined in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **UniProt lookup issue**: I attempted to look up the UniProt entries for some of the proteins, but encountered technical issues. It would be beneficial to confirm the precise functions of each protein from their UniProt entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Redundant evidence**: For some assertions, there are multiple identical pieces of evidence with the same PMID and contributor, which appears redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model (gomodel:66187e4700001573) is a biologically accurate and well-structured representation of the RNA capping process in *S. pombe*. It effectively captures the unique aspects of fission yeast capping machinery, where the enzymes operate independently rather than as a complex. The model correctly represents the sequential nature of the capping process and its regulation by RNA polymerase II.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices in terms of activity representation, causal relationships, and evidence citation. With minor improvements to complete subcellular localization information and consolidate redundant evidence, this would be an exemplary GO-CAM model.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:[66187e4700001597](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:66187e4700001597)) represents the human growth hormone receptor signaling pathway, focusing on key molecular components and their causal relationships in the signaling cascade. The model includes four primary activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Growth factor activity of GH1\n",
      "2. Growth hormone receptor activity of GHR\n",
      "3. Non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity of JAK2\n",
      "4. DNA-binding transcription factor activity of STAT5B\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model presents a sound representation of the growth hormone signaling pathway, accurately capturing the key components and causal relationships. It adheres to GO-CAM best practices and is biologically consistent with current literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate representation of signaling cascade**: The model correctly captures the flow of signaling from the extracellular growth hormone (GH1) through the membrane receptor (GHR), to downstream kinase activation (JAK2), and ultimately to transcriptional regulation (STAT5B).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate use of GO terms**: The model uses appropriate GO molecular function terms for each component.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct cellular compartmentalization**: Each component is appropriately localized (GH1 in extracellular space, GHR in plasma membrane, JAK2 at the cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane, and STAT5B in the nucleus).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Well-supported by evidence**: Each assertion is backed by literature evidence with appropriate references.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Correct causal connections**: The relationships between components accurately reflect the known signaling cascade, with proper use of causal predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Detailed Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. GH1 (Growth Hormone) Activity\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Function**: GO:0008083 (growth factor activity)\n",
      "- **Location**: GO:0005615 (extracellular space)\n",
      "- **Part of**: GO:0060396 (growth hormone receptor signaling pathway)\n",
      "- **Evidence**: ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) from PMID:1549776\n",
      "- **Causal relationship**: Directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) GHR activity\n",
      "\n",
      "This representation is accurate. Growth hormone (GH1) secreted into the extracellular space binds to its receptor on the cell surface and initiates signaling. The paper by de Vos et al. (1549776) provides strong evidence for this interaction through crystal structure analysis of the complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. GHR (Growth Hormone Receptor) Activity\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Function**: GO:0004903 (growth hormone receptor activity)\n",
      "- **Location**: GO:0005886 (plasma membrane)\n",
      "- **Part of**: GO:0060396 (growth hormone receptor signaling pathway)\n",
      "- **Evidence**: ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) from PMID:2825030\n",
      "- **Causal relationship**: Directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) JAK2 activity\n",
      "\n",
      "This representation is correct. GHR is properly localized to the plasma membrane, and its primary function in binding growth hormone is accurately depicted. The reference Leung et al. (2825030) provides direct evidence for GHR function and localization.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) Activity\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Function**: GO:0004715 (non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity)\n",
      "- **Location**: GO:0031234 (extrinsic component of cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane)\n",
      "- **Part of**: GO:0060397 (growth hormone receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT)\n",
      "- **Evidence**: ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) from PMID:15690087\n",
      "- **Causal relationship**: Provides input for (RO:0002407) STAT5B activity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents JAK2 as a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that associates with the cytoplasmic domain of GHR. The evidence from Greenhalgh et al. (15690087) provides solid support for JAK2's role in this pathway. The subcellular localization is supported by PMID:8007942 (Mui et al.), which demonstrates that JAK2 associates with the membrane-proximal region of cytokine receptors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. STAT5B (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5B) Activity\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Function**: GO:0003700 (DNA-binding transcription factor activity)\n",
      "- **Location**: GO:0005634 (nucleus)\n",
      "- **Part of**: GO:0060397 (growth hormone receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT)\n",
      "- **Evidence**: ECO:0000304 (author statement supported by traceable reference) from PMID:8631883\n",
      "\n",
      "The representation of STAT5B is accurate. Upon phosphorylation by JAK2, STAT5B dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor. The evidence from PMID:8631883 (Lin et al.) supports this function. The nuclear localization is supported by PMID:29844444, which discusses the translocation of STAT5B to the nucleus in response to phosphorylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Completeness\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the core components of the GH signaling pathway. A few additional elements that could potentially enhance the model include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The dimerization of GHR upon GH binding\n",
      "2. Specific phosphorylation sites on JAK2 and STAT5B\n",
      "3. Downstream targets of STAT5B transcriptional activity\n",
      "4. Negative regulators of the pathway such as SOCS proteins\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signaling receptor activity annotation**: The model correctly represents the relationship between the ligand (GH1) and its receptor (GHR), consistent with the guidelines in the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **DNA-binding transcription factor activity**: The representation of STAT5B follows the guidelines specified in the \"DNA-binding transcription factor activity annotation guidelines\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal predicates to connect activities in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consider adding receptor dimerization**: The literature (PMID:1549776) indicates that one GH molecule binds two GHR molecules, forming a 1:2 complex. This could be explicitly modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include negative regulation**: The pathway is regulated by negative feedback through SOCS proteins, particularly SOCS2 as indicated in PMID:15690087 and PMID:12552091. Adding these regulatory components would enhance the model's completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add specific phosphorylation sites**: The model could be enhanced by indicating the specific phosphorylation sites on JAK2 (Tyr1007/1008) and STAT5B (Tyr699).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Include more downstream effects**: The model could be expanded to include specific gene targets activated by STAT5B to provide a more complete picture of the biological outcomes of GH signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"The growth hormone receptor signaling pathway (Human)\" (gomodel:66187e4700001597) is a scientifically accurate and well-structured representation of the core GH signaling pathway. It follows GO-CAM best practices and is supported by appropriate evidence from the literature. While a few additional components could be added to enhance completeness, the current model effectively captures the key molecular activities and causal relationships in this important signaling pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the feedback regulation mechanism of growth hormone receptor (GHR) signaling through ubiquitination and degradation by the ECS(SOCS2) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in humans. The model illustrates a complete signaling pathway starting with growth hormone (GH) binding to its receptor, signal transduction through JAK2 and STAT5B, and the feedback inhibition mechanism via the SOCS2-containing E3 ligase complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Growth hormone (GH1)** activity as a growth factor (GO:0008083) in the extracellular space\n",
      "2. **Growth hormone receptor (GHR)** with receptor activity (GO:0004903) at the plasma membrane\n",
      "3. **JAK2** with protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004715)\n",
      "4. **STAT5B** with DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) in the nucleus\n",
      "5. **SOCS2** with ubiquitin ligase-substrate adaptor activity (GO:1990756)\n",
      "6. **CUL5** with ubiquitin ligase complex scaffold activity (GO:0160072)\n",
      "7. **RNF7/RBX2** with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the key components of the growth hormone receptor signaling pathway and its negative feedback regulation.\n",
      "2. The causal relationships between activities are correctly represented, showing how GH activates GHR, which activates JAK2, which then activates both STAT5B and SOCS2, with SOCS2 ultimately feeding back to inhibit GHR.\n",
      "3. The E3 ligase complex (ECS) components are correctly represented with appropriate molecular functions and causal relationships.\n",
      "4. All activities are properly annotated with appropriate GO terms.\n",
      "5. Each component is correctly assigned to its subcellular location.\n",
      "6. Evidence for each activity and relationship is properly referenced with PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conformance to GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows the E3 ubiquitin ligase annotation guidelines correctly:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For CUL5 (scaffold protein):\n",
      "   - Appropriate molecular function: ubiquitin ligase complex scaffold activity (GO:0160072)\n",
      "   - Part of proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161)\n",
      "   - Directly regulates SOCS2 (as expected for scaffold-adaptor relationship)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For SOCS2 (substrate adaptor):\n",
      "   - Appropriate molecular function: ubiquitin ligase-substrate adaptor activity (GO:1990756)\n",
      "   - Part of proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161)\n",
      "   - Located in cytoplasm\n",
      "   - Directly provides input for RNF7\n",
      "\n",
      "3. For RNF7 (E3 ligase):\n",
      "   - Appropriate molecular function: ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "   - Part of proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161)\n",
      "   - Located in cytoplasm\n",
      "   - Directly negatively regulates GHR (appropriate for representing the ubiquitination and degradation mechanism)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the biological pathway based on the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The PMID:21980433 paper clearly demonstrates that SOCS2 forms a complex with Elongin B/C, Cullin5, and Rbx2 (RNF7) to ubiquitinate GHR for proteasomal degradation.\n",
      "2. The model correctly shows that this ubiquitination leads to decreased GHR levels and therefore provides a negative feedback mechanism for GH signaling.\n",
      "3. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GHR by JAK2 is correctly shown as a prerequisite for SOCS2 binding and subsequent ubiquitination.\n",
      "4. The spatial localization of activities (e.g., GH in extracellular space, GHR at plasma membrane, STAT5B in nucleus) is consistent with known biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally very well constructed, I have a few minor recommendations for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological Process Annotation**: The JAK2 activity is annotated as part of GO:0060397 (growth hormone receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT) which is appropriate, but it could also be useful to add a more specific process term related to receptor phosphorylation if available.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Elongin Components**: While the model correctly represents the key components of the ECS complex, it doesn't explicitly include Elongin B and Elongin C, which are mentioned in the PMID:21980433 paper as important for SOCS2 stability and function. Including these components could provide a more complete representation of the complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mechanistic Detail**: The model could potentially be enhanced by representing the specific tyrosine residue on GHR (Tyr487) that is important for SOCS2 binding, as highlighted in PMID:21980433. This would add more mechanistic detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model provides an accurate and comprehensive representation of the feedback regulation of growth hormone receptor signaling through the SOCS2-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It follows GO-CAM best practices for representing E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and their activities. The model is well-supported by evidence and correctly represents the biological pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is an excellent example of how GO-CAM can be used to represent complex signaling pathways involving protein modifications and feedback regulation. It accurately captures the current state of knowledge about this pathway and would be useful for researchers interested in growth hormone signaling, SOCS proteins, or ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.\n",

      "\n",
      "This model represents the biological process of meiotic centromeric cohesion protection during anaphase I in fission yeast, which ensures that sister chromatids remain attached at centromeres throughout the first meiotic division.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological accuracy**: The model accurately captures the key components of the meiotic cohesion protection pathway, including Moa1, Plo1, Spc7, Shugoshin (Sgo1), PP2A phosphatase, and Rec8. The interactions represented align with current scientific understanding as evidenced in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-connected activities**: The model uses appropriate causal relations (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates) between activities, showing clear functional connections between proteins in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate molecular functions**: The molecular functions assigned to each gene product (e.g., kinetochore adaptor activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity) are accurate and supported by evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular context**: The model correctly places activities in their appropriate cellular locations (kinetochore, condensed chromosome centromeric region).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence attribution**: Each activity and relationship is supported by appropriate evidence codes and PMID references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing occurs_in relation for some activities**: Several activities in the model lack an \"occurs_in\" relation, including:\n",
      "   - Activity gomodel:66187e4700001744/66187e4700001974 (PomBase:SPBC16H5.07c, protein phosphatase activity)\n",
      "   - Activity gomodel:66187e4700001744/66187e4700001997 (PR:000050512, molecular adaptor activity)\n",
      "   - Activity gomodel:66187e4700001744/66187e4700001845 (PomBase:SPCC1322.12c, kinase activity)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete evidence for some causal associations**: Some causal associations lack evidence, such as:\n",
      "   - The relationship between PR:000050512 (Rec8) adaptor activity and Sgo1 activity\n",
      "   - One of the causal associations from SPAC664.01c (Swi6) to SPBP35G2.03c (Sgo1)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing key input molecules**: For the molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) enabled by PR:000050512 (Rec8), there are no \"has input\" relations defined. According to the literature and GO-CAM best practices, adaptors should specify the molecules they bring together through \"has input\" relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential simplification opportunity**: The model shows two nearly identical causal associations from SPAC664.01c (Swi6) to SPBP35G2.03c (Sgo1), which appears redundant and could be consolidated.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Incomplete part_of relations**: Some activities are missing \"part_of\" relations to the overall biological process (GO:1990813), particularly for PR:000027566 and PR:000027557.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add occurs_in relations**: Add appropriate cellular component locations for all activities that are currently missing this information.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add evidence for causal associations**: Provide evidence for the currently unsupported causal associations, particularly for the Rec8 adaptor activity relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Specify input molecules for adaptor activities**: For the molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) enabled by PR:000050512 (Rec8), add \"has input\" relations to specify which molecules this adaptor brings together.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consolidate redundant relations**: Review and consolidate the duplicate causal associations from SPAC664.01c (Swi6) to SPBP35G2.03c (Sgo1).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complete part_of relations**: Ensure all activities have appropriate \"part_of\" relations to the overall biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Enhance molecular clarity**: According to the literature, phosphorylation of Rec8 by Plo1 at S450 is a key event that promotes PP2A action. This specific mechanism could be more explicitly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of meiotic cohesion protection as described in the literature. The paper by Ma et al. (2021) supports the key relationships depicted in the model, particularly the role of Moa1-Plo1 in phosphorylating Rec8, which enhances Sgo1-PP2A activity to protect centromeric cohesion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the hierarchical regulation where:\n",
      "1. Moa1 recruits Plo1 to kinetochores\n",
      "2. Plo1 phosphorylates Spc7 and Rec8\n",
      "3. Phosphorylated Spc7 recruits Bub1\n",
      "4. Bub1 phosphorylates histone H2A\n",
      "5. Phosphorylated H2A recruits Sgo1 (Shugoshin)\n",
      "6. Sgo1 brings PP2A to centromeres\n",
      "7. PP2A dephosphorylates Rec8, preventing its cleavage by separase\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the meiotic cohesion protection pathway in fission yeast. With the suggested improvements, particularly regarding adaptor inputs and evidence for causal associations, the model would more comprehensively represent this important biological process and better adhere to GO-CAM best practices.\n",

      "This model represents the silent mating-type cassette heterochromatin assembly process in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* (taxon: NCBITaxon:4896). The model includes multiple proteins and their activities involved in heterochromatin formation at the mating-type locus.\n",

      "### Summary of the Model\n",
      "This model represents the erythropoietin-mediated signaling pathway in humans. It captures:\n",
      "- Erythropoietin (EPO) acting as a cytokine in the extracellular space\n",
      "- EPO binding to and activating the EPO receptor (EPOR) on the plasma membrane\n",
      "- EPOR activation leading to JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity\n",
      "- JAK2 phosphorylating STAT5B, which then acts as a transcription factor in the nucleus\n",
      "\n",
      "### Accuracy and Completeness\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Biological Content\n",
      "The model correctly represents the core aspects of the EPO signaling pathway, which is well-documented in the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **EPO Secretion and Location**: \n",
      "   - EPO (UniProtKB:P01588) is correctly annotated with cytokine activity (GO:0005125)\n",
      "   - EPO is properly located in the extracellular space (GO:0005615), which matches the UniProt entry\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **EPOR Activity and Location**:\n",
      "   - EPOR (UniProtKB:P19235) is correctly annotated with erythropoietin receptor activity (GO:0004900)\n",
      "   - EPOR is appropriately located at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - The evidence for EPOR's membrane location (ECO:0000250) is supported by the UniProt entry\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **JAK2 Activation**:\n",
      "   - JAK2 (UniProtKB:O60674) is correctly annotated with non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004715)\n",
      "   - JAK2 is correctly located at the extrinsic component of cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane (GO:0031234)\n",
      "   - The papers cited (PMID:9657743 and PMID:8007942) support that JAK2 associates with cytokine receptors and is activated by EPO\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **STAT5B Activation and Nuclear Translocation**:\n",

      "   - STAT5B is properly located in the nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "   - The activation pathway from JAK2 to STAT5B is supported by PMID:9657743, which shows EPO induces tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT5A, and STAT5B\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Causal Relationships in the Model\n",
      "The causal relationships in the model accurately reflect the biological pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. EPO directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) the activity of EPOR\n",
      "2. EPOR activity uses (RO:0002407) JAK2 activity\n",
      "3. JAK2 activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) STAT5B activity\n",
      "\n",
      "These relationships are consistent with the literature. According to PMID:9774108 and PMID:9657743, EPO binds to EPOR, leading to JAK2 activation, which then phosphorylates STAT5, allowing it to dimerize and translocate to the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Quality Control\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Proper Use of GO Terms\n",
      "The model uses appropriate GO terms for each molecule:\n",
      "\n",
      "- EPO: Cytokine activity (GO:0005125) - Appropriate for its function\n",
      "- EPOR: Erythropoietin receptor activity (GO:0004900) - Specific and accurate\n",
      "- JAK2: Non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004715) - Correctly describes JAK2's enzymatic function\n",
      "- STAT5B: DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) - Accurate for its role in the nucleus\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Appropriate Evidence\n",
      "Each activity in the model is supported by experimental evidence:\n",
      "\n",
      "- EPO cytokine activity: ECO:0000314 (direct assay) with PMID:9774108\n",
      "- EPOR receptor activity: ECO:0000314 (direct assay) with PMID:2163696\n",

      "\n",
      "The evidence codes are appropriate for the types of experimental data cited.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Cellular Locations\n",
      "The cellular locations are correctly specified:\n",
      "\n",
      "- EPO in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "- EPOR at plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "- JAK2 at cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane (GO:0031234)\n",
      "- STAT5B in nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "\n",
      "These locations accurately reflect the biology of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conformance to GO-CAM Curation Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "- It uses appropriate causal relationships between activities\n",
      "- Each activity is assigned to the correct molecule\n",
      "- Cellular locations are specified\n",
      "- All activities are part of the erythropoietin-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0038162)\n",
      "- Evidence is provided for each annotation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly handles complex representation by attributing activities to the specific proteins carrying them, rather than to the entire complex, following the guidelines in the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is scientifically accurate, there are a few areas that could be enhanced:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Receptor Complex Formation**:\n",
      "   - EPO binds to EPOR, causing receptor dimerization, which is a critical step for JAK2 activation. The model does not explicitly capture this dimerization event.\n",
      "   - According to PMID:9774108, EPO imposes a specific angular relationship (120°) between two EPOR molecules, which is essential for optimal signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **STAT5 Dimerization**:\n",
      "   - After phosphorylation by JAK2, STAT5B forms homodimers or heterodimers with STAT5A, which is an important step for DNA binding and transcriptional activity.\n",
      "   - This dimerization and the requirement of tyrosine phosphorylation (at Tyr-699 for STAT5B) for this process are not explicitly represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Downstream Events**:\n",
      "   - The pathway could be extended to include target genes regulated by STAT5B or other downstream effectors activated by JAK2 (like PI3K/AKT pathway).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:66187e4700002082) accurately represents the core erythropoietin-mediated signaling pathway with appropriate annotations, evidence, and causal relationships. It correctly captures the sequence of events from EPO binding to EPOR, leading to JAK2 activation and STAT5B-mediated transcription.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is appropriately concise while capturing the essential features of the pathway. The annotations are well-supported by evidence from the literature, and the causal relationships accurately reflect our understanding of EPO signaling.\n",

      "6. The ECS(SOCS2) complex targets activated EPOR for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation\n",
      "7. This creates a negative feedback loop that regulates EPO signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological consistency**: The model accurately represents the known EPO signaling pathway and its regulation through the ECS(SOCS2) complex as supported by the literature (PMID:9774108, PMID:11781573, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper annotation of molecular functions**: The molecular functions of each protein in the model are accurately represented with appropriate GO terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular localization**: The model correctly annotates the subcellular locations where each activity occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate use of causal relationships**: Most causal relationships use appropriate predicates according to GO-CAM guidelines (RO:0002629 for direct positive regulation, RO:0002630 for direct negative regulation, RO:0002413 for providing input).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Duplicate causal association**: There are duplicate causal associations from CUL5 to SOCS2. They both use the same predicate (RO:0002629) but have different evidence attributions (one to ORCID:0000-0001-7299-6685 and another to ORCID:0000-0001-6787-2901).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing causal relationship**: There should be a clear causal relationship between JAK2 and STAT5B, but it's missing from the model. According to the literature, JAK2 directly phosphorylates and activates STAT5B in the EPO signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **STAT5B annotation**: While STAT5B is included in the model, its downstream effects (e.g., transcriptional activation of target genes) are not represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence for EPOR location**: The occurrence of EPOR in the plasma membrane is supported only by evidence code ECO:0000250 (sequence similarity evidence) with a reference to mouse data, rather than direct experimental evidence in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Clarity of ubiquitination process**: While the model shows that RNF7 negatively regulates EPOR, it doesn't clearly depict the process of EPOR ubiquitination that leads to its degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove duplicate causal association**: Remove one of the duplicate causal associations from CUL5 to SOCS2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add missing causal relationship**: Add a direct positive regulation (RO:0002629) causal relationship from JAK2 to STAT5B to complete the signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expand STAT5B activity**: Consider adding the downstream effects of STAT5B activation, such as transcriptional activation of target genes involved in erythrocyte development.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Improve evidence for EPOR location**: If possible, add direct experimental evidence for the plasma membrane localization of EPOR in human cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Clarify ubiquitination process**: Consider adding more detail about the ubiquitination process, such as specific ubiquitination sites on EPOR and the K48-linked polyubiquitination that typically signals for proteasomal degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Add temporal dimension**: Consider adding annotations that reflect the temporal sequence of events in the pathway (initial activation followed by feedback inhibition).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, GO-CAM model 66187e4700002129 provides a good representation of the feedback regulation of EPO signaling via the ECS(SOCS2) complex.

      "- GAP proteins (Cdc16/Byr4) properly shown negatively regulating Spg1\n",
      "- The downstream kinase cascade (Cdc7 → Sid1 → Sid2) follows correct biological sequence\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues Identified\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing molecular functions**: Several proteins have GO:0003674 (molecular_function) listed, which is a placeholder for \"unknown molecular function\":\n",
      "   - PomBase:SPAC2C4.10c (csc4)\n",
      "   - PomBase:SPBC3H7.13 (csc1)\n",
      "   - PomBase:SPBC27B12.04c (csc2)\n",

      "   - PomBase:SPAC1782.05 (ypa2)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing evidence codes**: Some causal associations lack evidence:\n",
      "   - The causal association between csc4 (SPAC2C4.10c) and ppa3 (SPAC22H10.04)\n",
      "   - The causal association between csc2 (SPBC27B12.04c) and ppa3 (SPAC22H10.04)\n",
      "   - The causal association between csc3 (SPBC1773.01) and ppa3 (SPAC22H10.04)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incomplete cellular context**: While most activities have appropriate cellular locations, a few are missing contextual information about where the activity occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence quality**: Most associations use appropriate experimental evidence codes, but there are instances where stronger evidence could be used (like ECO:0000269 \"experimental evidence used in manual assertion\" instead of ECO:0000353 \"physical interaction evidence\").\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Consistency Review\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of the SIN pathway in *S. pombe* as documented in the literature. Key components and interactions match with published research:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The central role of Spg1 GTPase and its regulation by Byr4/Cdc16 GAP\n",
      "2. The activation of Cdc7 kinase by GTP-bound Spg1\n",
      "3. The downstream signaling through Sid1 and Sid2 kinases\n",
      "4. The roles of phosphatases (Clp1, Ppa3) in regulating the pathway\n",
      "5. The inhibitory role of Cdc2 (CDK) on specific SIN components\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular function annotations**: Most proteins have appropriate molecular functions assigned (kinase activities, GTPase activities, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological process annotations**: Activities are appropriately placed within specific biological processes:\n",
      "   - GO:0031028 (septation initiation signaling)\n",
      "   - GO:0031030 (negative regulation of septation initiation signaling)\n",
      "   - GO:0031031 (positive regulation of septation initiation signaling)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular component annotations**: Activities are correctly localized to relevant cellular structures:\n",
      "   - GO:0044732 (mitotic spindle pole body)\n",
      "   - GO:0071957 (old mitotic spindle pole body)\n",
      "   - GO:0071958 (new mitotic spindle pole body)\n",
      "   - GO:0110085 (mitotic actomyosin contractile ring)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence codes**: The model generally uses appropriate evidence codes with PMIDs to support assertions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete the missing molecular functions**: For proteins currently annotated with GO:0003674, either:\n",
      "   - Determine specific molecular functions from literature\n",
      "   - Note that these are likely scaffold proteins that may require specific molecular function terms\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add missing evidence**: Provide evidence for all causal associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Review evidence quality**: Consider strengthening evidence codes where possible (e.g., from inference to direct experimental evidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Ensure pathway completeness**: Consider if any known regulators or components of the SIN pathway are missing from the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Check additional linkages**: Consider whether the SIN pathway should be connected to other pathways, such as cell cycle regulation or actomyosin ring assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-structured GO-CAM model that accurately represents the septation initiation signaling pathway in *S. pombe*. It contains appropriate molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components, and most causal associations are well supported by evidence.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Components and Activities\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four main molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **IL-2 Cytokine Activity** (GO:0005125)\n",
      "   - Enabled by: IL-2 (UniProtKB:P60568)\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Cytokine Activity** (GO:0005125)\n",

      "   - Enabled by: SECTM1 (UniProtKB:Q8WVN6)\n",
      "   - Occurs in: Plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - Part of: Positive regulation of T cell cytokine production (GO:0002726)\n",
      "   - Causally affects: CD7 transmembrane signaling receptor activity via \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Flow in the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model describes a signaling pathway where:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. IFN-gamma provides input for SECTM1's receptor ligand activity\n",
      "2. SECTM1 directly positively regulates CD7's transmembrane signaling receptor activity\n",
      "3. CD7 provides input for IL-2 cytokine activity\n",
      "\n",
      "This creates a causal chain: IFN-gamma → SECTM1 → CD7 → IL-2\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "- SECTM1-CD7 interaction is documented in PMID:10652336, which identified CD7 as a cognate of the SECTM1 (K12) protein\n",
      "- IFN-gamma regulation of SECTM1 is supported by PMID:15742156, which showed that IFN-gamma induces SECTM1 expression in thymic epithelial cells\n",
      "- CD7's role in T cell activation leading to IL-2 production is documented in multiple references\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological Accuracy**: The model correctly captures the molecular interactions between SECTM1 and CD7, and the role of IFN-gamma in regulating SECTM1 expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper Use of Causal Relations**: The model uses appropriate causal relationships between activities (RO:0002407 \"has input from\" and RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Support**: Each component of the model is supported by published literature evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Anatomical Context**: Cellular locations are properly specified for each activity (extracellular space for cytokines, plasma membrane for receptors).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Biological Process Context**: Each activity is correctly associated with relevant biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I've identified a few potential points for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal Relation from IFN-gamma to SECTM1**: The model uses RO:0002407 \"has input from\", but based on the literature, IFN-gamma induces SECTM1 expression, which might be better represented with RO:0002304 \"causally upstream of, positive effect\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular Details of CD7 Signaling**: The model does not capture the downstream signaling events after CD7 activation (such as the activation of specific kinases or transcription factors that lead to IL-2 production).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Temporal Aspect**: The model does not explicitly represent the temporal sequence - IFN-gamma induces SECTM1, which then interacts with pre-existing CD7 on T cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:66187e4700002599 is a well-constructed representation of the SECTM1-CD7 interaction leading to cytokine production upon T-cell activation. It accurately captures the key molecular players and their interactions in this signaling pathway, with proper evidence support from the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents that SECTM1 is a ligand for CD7, which leads to T cell activation and IL-2 production, and that IFN-gamma induces SECTM1 expression. All protein functions are correctly annotated based on their molecular activities and cellular locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "This model provides a valuable contribution to understanding the mechanisms of T cell activation and cytokine production, particularly in the context of human immune responses.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:66187e4700002704](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:66187e4700002704)) is titled \"Inhibition of reelin signaling via ubiquitination and degradation of DAB1 by the ECS(SOCS7) complex in the cortical plate of the developing cerebral cortex (Human).\" It represents a key pathway in neuronal development, specifically how reelin signaling is regulated through DAB1 protein degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Pathway Represented\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the reelin-mediated signaling pathway which is critical for proper neuronal migration and positioning during brain development. The pathway represented includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reelin (RELN) acting as a receptor ligand\n",
      "2. Activation of LRP8 (reelin receptor)\n",
      "3. FYN kinase activation\n",
      "4. Phosphorylation of DAB1 (disabled homolog 1)\n",
      "5. SOCS7-mediated recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex \n",
      "6. Ubiquitination and degradation of DAB1 by the CUL5-RBX2-SOCS7 complex\n",
      "\n",
      "This pathway is crucial for proper neuronal positioning in the developing cerebral cortex, as the regulated degradation of DAB1 helps control the extent and duration of reelin signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Components and Molecular Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents several key proteins and their molecular functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **RELN (P78509)** - Reelin acts as a receptor ligand (GO:0048018)\n",
      "2. **LRP8 (Q14114-4)** - Functions as a reelin receptor (GO:0038025)\n",
      "3. **FYN (P06241)** - Protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713)\n",
      "4. **DAB1 (O75553)** - Signaling adaptor activity (GO:0035591)\n",
      "5. **SOCS7 (O14512)** - Ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity (GO:1990756)\n",

      "7. **CUL5 (Q93034)** - Ubiquitin ligase complex scaffold activity (GO:0160072)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model properly captures the following causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. RELN directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) LRP8\n",
      "2. LRP8 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) FYN\n",
      "3. FYN directly provides input for (RO:0002413) SOCS7 and directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) DAB1\n",
      "4. SOCS7 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) RNF7\n",
      "5. RNF7 directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) DAB1\n",
      "6. CUL5 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) SOCS7\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Process Context\n",
      "\n",
      "All the activities are correctly placed in the context of relevant biological processes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. RELN, LRP8, FYN, and DAB1 activities are parts of the reelin-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0038026)\n",
      "2. CUL5, SOCS7, and RNF7 activities are parts of the proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by evidence:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Most relationships are supported by experimental evidence codes, primarily ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) or ECO:0000250 (sequence similarity evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "2. The primary reference PMID:34518685 provides strong evidence for the CUL5-ARIH2 E3-E3 ubiquitin ligase structure and mechanism, which is directly relevant to the model\n",
      "3. Other references include PMID:16979591 and PMID:30873003 which further support the relationships in the model\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment of Model Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the reelin signaling pathway and its regulation through ubiquitination\n",
      "2. The causal relationships between components are biologically sound and well-supported by evidence\n",
      "3. The model includes appropriate molecular function annotations for each protein\n",
      "4. The cellular location context is properly specified (extracellular space, plasma membrane, cytoplasm)\n",
      "5. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes, as proteins with known activities are represented individually rather than using a complex ID\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological Process Annotation**: While the model correctly places activities in relevant biological processes, it could benefit from explicitly including GO:0021819 (layer formation in cerebral cortex) as this is the ultimate biological outcome of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular Localization Precision**: The model could be enhanced by specifying that these events occur specifically in the cortical plate (UBERON:0005343) of the developing cerebral cortex.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness of E3 Ligase Complex**: The model correctly represents the CUL5-RBX2-SOCS7 (ECS-SOCS7) complex, but it could be more complete by including the Elongin B and Elongin C components, which are known to be part of the ECS complex. However, this omission is acceptable according to GO-CAM complex annotation guidelines since the key functional components with known activities are represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the GO-CAM model (gomodel:66187e4700002704) is a high-quality representation of the inhibition of reelin signaling via ubiquitination and degradation of DAB1 by the ECS(SOCS7) complex. The model correctly captures the causal relationships between components, provides appropriate context, and is well-supported by evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows good GO-CAM annotation practices by correctly representing each component's molecular function and placing them in appropriate biological processes and cellular contexts. The representation of the E3 ligase complex is in accordance with GO-CAM guidelines for complex annotation, as it includes the components with known specific activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "This model successfully represents a key regulatory mechanism in neuronal development and provides a valuable resource for understanding how reelin signaling is regulated through DAB1 degradation.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents the following causal relationships:\n",
      "- RELN directly positively regulates LRP8 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "- LRP8 directly positively regulates FYN (RO:0002629)\n",
      "- FYN directly positively regulates DAB1 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "\n",
      "These relationships accurately reflect the canonical reelin signaling pathway where reelin binds to its receptors (LRP8/ApoER2), leading to activation of Fyn kinase, which then phosphorylates DAB1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Locations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly annotates the cellular locations of the proteins:\n",
      "- RELN in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "- LRP8 in plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "- DAB1 in cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "\n",
      "These localizations are consistent with the known biology of these proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Missing Component: VLDLR\n",
      "\n",
      "The model lacks the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which is another important receptor for reelin alongside LRP8. The PMID:30873003 paper clearly demonstrates that both ApoER2 (LRP8) and VLDLR are involved in reelin signaling and both can mediate Dab1 phosphorylation. Genetic experiments have shown that only the double knockout of both receptors recapitulates the full \"reeler phenotype\" (Trommsdorff et al.), whereas loss of either receptor alone produces distinctive phenotypes on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: Add VLDLR to the model with reelin receptor activity (GO:0038025) and show it being regulated by RELN similarly to LRP8.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Receptor Oligomerization\n",
      "\n",
      "As demonstrated in PMID:30873003, both LRP8 (ApoER2) and VLDLR form homo-oligomers in the absence of reelin, and full-length reelin increases the size of these clusters, which is critical for signaling. The model does not capture this clustering behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: Consider adding appropriate annotations to capture the oligomerization of receptors and how this is enhanced by reelin binding.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Phosphorylation of DAB1\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly shows FYN acting on DAB1, but it doesn't specifically capture the phosphorylation event. The PMID:16979591 and other references clearly show that Fyn phosphorylates DAB1 at specific tyrosine residues, which is a critical event in the signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: Explicitly annotate the phosphorylation of DAB1 by FYN, possibly using a more specific GO term for the activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Biological Process Annotations\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model correctly includes the reelin-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0038026) as a biological process, it could benefit from additional biological process annotations that capture the downstream effects of this pathway, such as neuronal migration or layer formation in the cerebral cortex.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: Add additional biological process terms to capture the downstream effects of reelin signaling, such as \"layer formation in cerebral cortex\" (GO:0021819).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Evidence Codes\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses ECO:0000250 (sequence similarity evidence used in manual assertion) and ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) as evidence codes, which are appropriate. However, for some assertions, more specific evidence could be provided, especially from human studies where available.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**: Ensure all assertions have appropriate evidence codes and citations, preferably from human studies when available.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:66187e4700002778 provides a good representation of the core components and causal relationships in the reelin signaling pathway in humans. However, it could be improved by adding VLDLR as another reelin receptor, capturing receptor oligomerization, explicitly annotating the phosphorylation of DAB1, adding more specific biological process annotations, and ensuring all assertions have appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the model is scientifically sound but would benefit from these enhancements to provide a more complete and detailed representation of reelin signaling.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes the interaction between Interferon alpha-1 (IFNA1) and Complement receptor type 2 (CR2) in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in human B-cells. The model outlines the signaling pathway from IFNA1 binding to CR2, which then activates downstream effectors (EIF2AK2/PKR and MX1) in the antiviral innate immune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of 4 main activity units:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **IFNA1 (P01562)** with cytokine activity (GO:0005125) in the extracellular space\n",
      "2. **CR2 (P20023)** with transmembrane signaling receptor activity (GO:0004888) in the plasma membrane\n",
      "3. **MX1 (P20591)** with GTPase activity (GO:0003924) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "4. **EIF2AK2/PKR (P19525)** with kinase activity (GO:0016301) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "\n",
      "The model establishes causal connections using RO:0002407 (provides input for) from CR2 to both MX1 and EIF2AK2, and RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) from IFNA1 to CR2.\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are part of the type I interferon-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0060337).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model cites several PMIDs as evidence, primarily:\n",
      "- PMID:1849076 (Delcayre et al., 1991) - Documents CR2 as an interferon alpha receptor\n",
      "- PMID:30936491 (Review on interferon signaling)\n",
      "- PMID:21859714 (Interaction of MX1 with cellular RNA helicases)\n",
      "- PMID:21123651 (Phosphorylation of NFAR proteins by PKR)\n",
      "- PMID:22948139 (Role of PKR in antiviral immune response)\n",
      "- PMID:25930096 (MX1 role in antiviral innate immune response)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents a non-canonical interferon signaling pathway through CR2 (not the typical IFNAR1/2 complex), which is supported by literature.\n",
      "2. The molecular activities are correctly annotated with appropriate GO terms.\n",
      "3. The cellular locations are appropriate for each protein (extracellular for IFNA1, plasma membrane for CR2, cytoplasm for MX1 and EIF2AK2).\n",
      "4. The causal relationships are consistent with the biological process of type I interferon signaling.\n",
      "5. The evidence provided (PMIDs) supports the interactions represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing host cell receptor annotation**: According to the GO-CAM signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines, when a ligand binds to a receptor, the relationship should be \"has input\" from the ligand to the receptor, but this is not included in the model. Currently, IFNA1 directly positively regulates CR2, which is correct, but the input relationship is missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Receptor target specification**: For the CR2 receptor, the guideline states that the receptor's input should be the effector protein it regulates, but the model does not specify CR2's direct input. Instead, it shows CR2 providing input for both downstream effectors (MX1 and EIF2AK2) which would benefit from additional mechanistic clarification.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limited ISG representation**: Despite the title mentioning \"ISGs induction,\" the model only includes two ISGs (MX1 and EIF2AK2/PKR). The model would benefit from including additional relevant ISGs or at least mentioning the broader ISG induction process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing molecular mechanisms**: The model doesn't detail the precise molecular mechanisms of how CR2 activation leads to MX1 and EIF2AK2 activation. Additional intermediate steps in this signaling pathway would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence updates**: While PMID:1849076 is a solid foundation for the IFNA1-CR2 interaction, it's from 1991. Adding more recent evidence for this interaction would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add an \"has input\" relationship from IFNA1 to CR2 to properly annotate the ligand-receptor interaction according to guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Consider adding the specific downstream targets of CR2 activation with appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Expand the model to include additional ISGs and/or the broader mechanisms of ISG induction.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Add intermediate steps in the signaling pathway between CR2 and the effector proteins MX1 and EIF2AK2.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Include more recent evidence for the IFNA1-CR2 interaction if available in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Consider adding information on how this non-canonical signaling pathway integrates with the canonical type I interferon signaling through IFNAR1/2 complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The model [gomodel:66187e4700002881](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:66187e4700002881) provides a valid representation of the IFNA1-CR2 interaction in B-cell ISG induction, supported by evidence from the literature. The causal relationships and GO annotations are appropriate, though the model could be enhanced by adding more detailed molecular mechanisms and by adhering more strictly to the signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines. With these improvements, this model would provide a more comprehensive representation of this non-canonical interferon signaling pathway in human B-cells.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the GDP-mannose biosynthetic pathway in mice, starting from glucose rather than mannose. The pathway consists of 5 connected activities performed by different mouse proteins, culminating in the production of GDP-mannose, which is an essential precursor for glycosylation processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts a linear pathway with the following activities connected by causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Hexokinase 1 (HK1, MGI:MGI:96103)** - catalyzes the conversion of D-glucopyranose to alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate in the cytosol\n",
      "2. **Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI1, MGI:MGI:95797)** - converts alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate to beta-D-fructofuranose 6-phosphate\n",
      "3. **Mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (MPI, MGI:MGI:97075)** - converts beta-D-fructofuranose 6-phosphate to D-mannose 6-phosphate\n",
      "4. **Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2, MGI:MGI:1859214)** - converts D-mannose 6-phosphate to alpha-D-mannose 1-phosphate\n",
      "5. **GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase B (GMPPB, MGI:MGI:2660880)** - uses alpha-D-mannose 1-phosphate and GTP to generate GDP-alpha-D-mannose and diphosphate\n",
      "\n",
      "Each activity is properly connected via the \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) causal relationship, showing the progression of substrates through the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate Gene Products**: The model uses the correct mouse genes for each step of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct Substrates and Products**: Each activity has the appropriate inputs and outputs, matching the enzymatic reactions described in the literature.\n",

      "4. **Evidence Support**: The model includes appropriate evidence codes and literature references for each assertion.\n",

      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete Evidence for Locations**: While the subcellular locations are properly annotated, some of the evidence references could be strengthened. For example, the evidence for HK1 being in the cytosol uses PMID:12420306, which is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological Process Consistency**: All activities are annotated as being part of GO:0009298 (GDP-mannose biosynthetic process), which is correct. However, it would be beneficial to also include annotations to more specific processes where applicable, such as GO:0061729 (GDP-mannose biosynthetic process from fructose-6-phosphate) for the MPI activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Specificity**: Some evidence codes use sequence orthology (ECO:0000266) rather than direct experimental evidence in mice. This is acceptable when mouse-specific data is unavailable, but where possible, mouse-specific evidence would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Literature Alignment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model aligns well with the literature regarding the GDP-mannose biosynthetic pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **PMID:27053713** provides evidence for PMM2 activity in this pathway, showing how defects in this enzyme cause congenital disorders of glycosylation. This study demonstrated that PMM2 activity is responsible for the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **PMID:35006422** supports the role of GMPPB in catalyzing the formation of GDP-mannose, and its mutations lead to GMPPB-associated congenital disorders of glycosylation.\n",

      "3. **PMID:12122025** provides evidence for MPI's role in converting fructose-6-phosphate to mannose-6-phosphate.\n",

This pathway is essential for providing GDP-mannose, which serves as a sugar donor for various glycosylation processes including N-glycosylation, O-mannosylation, C-mannosylation, and GPI-anchor formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly shows that glucose is first phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate, then isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate, which is then converted to mannose-6-phosphate, followed by conversion to mannose-1-phosphate, and finally to GDP-mannose.\n",

      "5. **Molecular inputs and outputs**: For enzymatic reactions like adenylate cyclase (Cyr1) and phosphodiesterase (Cgs2), the model correctly represents chemical inputs and outputs (ATP → cAMP, and cAMP → AMP).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing molecular function for Git7**: Activity (gomodel:66187e4700003150/662af8fa00000685) for Git7 is annotated with the generic \"molecular_function\" (GO:0003674) without specific function defined, which should be replaced with a more specific term when evidence is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence gaps**: Some causal associations lack evidence annotations, particularly:\n",
      "   - The causal relationship between Git7 (SPBC36.12c) and Cyr1 (SPBC19C7.03)\n",
      "   - Some other relationships also have limited evidence documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **G-protein complex representation**: According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, the G-protein complex components (Gpa2, Git5, Git11) are appropriately represented by their individual activities, but there could be clearer annotations about how they form the heterotrimeric G-protein complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Signaling receptor annotation**: Based on the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\", the GPCR Git3 (SPCC1753.02c) is correctly annotated with a receptor activity (GO:1990576) and occurs in the plasma membrane. However, the model could more explicitly capture the small molecule activator relationship with glucose.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Biological process cohesion**: While most activities are appropriately part of GO:0010619 (adenylate cyclase-activating glucose-activated G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway), some activities are part of the negative regulation process (GO:0110034) but could benefit from clearer annotation of how they connect back to the main process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add missing molecular function**: Define a specific molecular function for Git7 (SPBC36.12c) based on available literature evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complete evidence documentation**: Add evidence annotations for all causal relationships, particularly for Git7's effect on Cyr1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enhance small molecule representation**: Consider explicitly representing glucose as a small molecule activator of the Git3 receptor using the appropriate relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Review regulatory loops**: The model includes negative regulation components (Cgs2, Sck1), which appear to represent a feedback mechanism. Consider reviewing this against the \"Regulation and Regulatory Processes in GO-CAM\" guidelines to ensure proper representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Maintain consistency in evidence types**: The model uses a mix of evidence codes (ECO:0000314, ECO:0000315, ECO:0000353); while this is valid, ensure that the strongest available evidence is used for each annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents what is known about GPCR signaling in fission yeast, where the Git3 receptor senses glucose leading to activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex (Gpa2-Git5-Git11), which then activates adenylate cyclase (Cyr1) to produce cAMP. This pathway is crucial for nutrient sensing and adaptation to glucose in fission yeast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The negative regulation components through phosphodiesterase (Cgs2) and PKA-mediated signaling are biologically accurate and reflect the known feedback mechanisms in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model (gomodel:66187e4700003150) is a well-constructed representation of the adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway in *S. pombe*. With some minor improvements to molecular function specificity and evidence documentation, it would be an excellent reference model for this pathway. The model follows most GO-CAM best practices and presents a biologically accurate view of GPCR signaling in fission yeast.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. SAG-CUL5 (but not RBX1-CUL1) promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of β-TrCP1\n",
      "2. This ubiquitination occurs via an atypical K11-linkage mediated by E2 enzymes UBCH10/UBE2C and UBE2S\n",
      "3. This establishes a cross-talk between CRL5 and CRL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compliance with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows the GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes:\n",

      "- The causal relationships between activities are appropriate for the biological process\n",
      "- CUL5's scaffold role is represented first, providing input for the downstream activities\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mechanistic Detail**: The model captures the selective E2-E3 interactions that determine ubiquitin chain specificity (K11 linkage)\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10) metabolic process in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* (fission yeast). The model focuses on the biosynthetic pathway of CoQ10, showing the activities and relationships between multiple proteins involved in this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model effectively captures the main steps of the CoQ10 biosynthetic pathway in *S. pombe*, including:\n",
      "   - The initial steps of isoprenoid synthesis (Fps1, Spo9)\n",
      "   - Multiple steps of benzoquinone modification (Coq3, Coq5, Coq6, Coq7)\n",
      "   - The precursor transfer step (Ppt1)\n",
      "   - The final product (CoQ10) is properly specified as the output\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate cellular localization**: The model correctly annotates the subcellular locations of the activities:\n",
      "   - Mitochondrial inner membrane and extrinsic components for most Coq proteins\n",
      "   - Cytosolic location for isoprenoid synthesis enzymes\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clear causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationships between activities, mostly using:\n",
      "   - RO:0002413 (provides input for) for sequential steps\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for the regulatory role of Azr1\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence support**: Activities are supported by appropriate evidence codes and references, including:\n",
      "   - Literature references (PMIDs)\n",
      "   - Appropriate ECO evidence codes\n",
      "   - Reference to orthologous proteins from other organisms where applicable\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Regulatory aspects**: The inclusion of Azr1's protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity as a regulator of CoQ10 biosynthesis aligns with the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Duplicate causal relationships**:\n",
      "   There are several instances where the same causal relationship between two activities is represented twice. For example:\n",
      "   - Two identical causal relationships from Fps1 to Dlp1/Dps1\n",
      "   - Two identical causal relationships from Spo9 to Dlp1/Dps1\n",
      "   - Two identical causal relationships from Azr1 to Coq7\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Remove duplicate causal relationships to maintain model clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Coq10 representation**:\n",
      "   The model includes Coq10 as a molecular carrier activity that takes CoQ10 as input, but there are no causal relationships linking this activity to other parts of the pathway. Based on the literature I reviewed, Coq10 is a CoQ-binding protein that facilitates the use of CoQ in the respiratory chain.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Either add appropriate causal relationships showing how Coq10 relates to the other activities, or include a note explaining its role in CoQ10 utilization rather than biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing decarboxylation step**:\n",
      "   According to the literature, the CoQ10 biosynthesis pathway includes a decarboxylation step that is performed by an unknown enzyme in *S. pombe*. This step isn't explicitly represented in the model.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **Recommendation**: If possible, include this step in the pathway, even if the specific protein is unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Organization of the pathway**:\n",
      "   While the causal relationships are accurate, the flow of activities could be more clearly organized to reflect the linear progression of the pathway from isoprenoid synthesis to final CoQ10 production.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Reorganize the visual layout to better represent the sequential nature of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consistency in annotation**:\n",
      "   Some activities have extensive evidence annotations while others have minimal evidence. For example, the evidence for Coq10's role has empty evidence fields.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Ensure consistent evidence annotation across all activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the literature I reviewed, the model generally represents the biological process accurately:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model correctly shows that *S. pombe* produces CoQ10 with ten isoprene units, unlike *S. cerevisiae* which produces CoQ6.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The enzyme relationships match what is known about the CoQ10 biosynthetic pathway in *S. pombe*.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The inclusion of Azr1 as a regulatory protein is supported by literature showing that it positively regulates the ubiquinone biosynthetic process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The model correctly represents that decaprenyl diphosphate synthase in *S. pombe* is a heterotetramer composed of Dps1 and Dlp1, unlike in *S. cerevisiae* where it's a homomer.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the ubiquinone metabolic process in *S. pombe*. It captures the key proteins, their activities, and the causal relationships between them. The few issues noted are primarily related to redundant relationships and organization rather than biological accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model will be valuable for researchers studying coenzyme Q biosynthesis in yeast and comparing it with other organisms. It successfully integrates information from multiple published studies to provide a comprehensive view of this important metabolic pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend accepting this model with minor revisions to address the duplicate causal relationships and to clarify the role of Coq10 in the pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This model captures the molecular pathway of GSDMD (Gasdermin D) palmitoylation by ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC9, which promotes pyroptosis in mouse. The model describes how caspase-4 cleaves GSDMD, allowing GSDMD to form pores in the plasma membrane, leading to pyroptotic cell death.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Structure and Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Evidence and References**: The model is well-supported with appropriate references (PMIDs: 30135078, 38530158, 27339137, etc.) and evidence codes (ECO:0000314, ECO:0000250, ECO:0000315).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Associations**: The causal relationships between activities are logically established, showing a clear pathway from palmitoylation to pyroptosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Compartments**: Each activity has appropriate cellular compartment specifications (plasma membrane, cytosol, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Process Associations**: Each activity is placed in its correct biological process context.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tax𐅍on Inconsistency**: The model title specifies \"Mouse\" but the taxon field is set to \"NCBITaxon:9606\" (human). This should be corrected to \"NCBITaxon:10090\" (mouse) to match the model content, as all the proteins are mouse proteins (MGI IDs).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Association Evidence**: Some causal associations lack explicit evidence codes and references, particularly:\n",
      "   - The causal association between GSDMD's phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding (662af8fa00002245) and wide pore channel activity (662af8fa00002249)\n",
      "   - The causal association between Casp4's activity (662af8fa00002231) and GSDMD's binding activity (662af8fa00002245)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incomplete Predicate Use**: While the model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) and RO:0002304 (causally upstream of, positive effect), it also uses RO:0002407 which appears to be potentially incorrect or outdated. The intended relationship was likely one of the standard causal predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pathway Completeness**: Based on PMID:38530158, ROS also facilitates the palmitoylation process, but this is not captured in the model. Consider adding this aspect for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mechanism Accuracy**: The model correctly captures that ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC9 are palmitoylating GSDMD at Cys191/Cys192, which is supported by the reference (PMID:38530158).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cleavage Process**: According to PMID:30135078, Caspase-4 (Casp4) cleaves GSDMD at Asp276, which is an essential step for pyroptosis. While the cleavage activity is represented, the specific cleavage site could be more explicitly captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pore Formation Mechanism**: The sequence of events from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding to wide pore channel formation is accurately represented, aligning with the literature (PMID:27339137).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **NLRP3 Connection**: The model includes NLRP3's signaling adaptor activity, which is connected to the pathway. This is consistent with the role of NLRP3 in pyroptosis as described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fix Taxon**: Change the taxon from human (NCBITaxon:9606) to mouse (NCBITaxon:10090) to match the model content.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add Evidence to Causal Associations**: Provide evidence codes and references for all causal associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Review Predicates**: Ensure all relationship predicates are correctly applied, especially checking RO:0002407.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Adding ROS Facilitation**: The paper mentioned that reactive oxygen species (ROS) facilitate the palmitoylation process - this could be added to the model for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add Specificity to Cleavage Site**: Consider adding information about the specific cleavage site (Asp276) in GSDMD, which is critical for its activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Consider Adding FASN**: PMID:38530158 mentions Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) as a GSDMD-binding partner. Consider adding this interaction to the model if it provides important context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that effectively captures the molecular pathway of GSDMD palmitoylation by ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC9 leading to pyroptosis. With the suggested improvements, particularly fixing the taxon inconsistency and adding evidence to all causal associations, the model will more accurately represent the biological process and align better with GO-CAM best practices.\n",

      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: CD28/GRB2 axis leading to RAS activation (Human)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:662af8fa00002332) represents the CD28/GRB2 axis that leads to RAS activation in human T cells. The model describes the signaling pathway initiated by CD80/CD86 binding to CD28, which triggers a cascade through GRB2 adaptor recruitment leading to activation of guanyl-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as VAV1 and SOS1.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the well-established CD28 co-stimulatory pathway that is critical for T cell activation. Key features include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Receptor-Ligand Interactions**: The model correctly shows that both CD80 (P33681) and CD86 (P42081) function as receptor ligands that positively regulate CD28's coreceptor activity. This is consistent with literature showing these molecules are primary costimulatory ligands for CD28.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **CD28 Signaling**: CD28 (P10747) is appropriately annotated with coreceptor activity (GO:0015026) and is shown to directly positively regulate GRB2 (P62993), which is supported by multiple studies (including PMID:9784967).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **GRB2 Adaptor Function**: GRB2 is correctly annotated with molecular adaptor activity (GO:0030674), which is its primary function in signaling cascades as documented in UniProt.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **GEF Activation**: The model shows GRB2 directly positively regulating both VAV1 (P15498) and SOS1 (Q07889), which are both annotated with guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity (GO:0005085). This is consistent with the established role of GRB2 in recruiting these GEFs during T cell activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Structure and Connectivity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model has a clear and logical flow with appropriate causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The causal relationships use proper RO terms (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\") to connect activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. All activities are connected in a biologically meaningful way that reflects the signaling flow from cell surface receptors (CD80/CD86) to CD28 to GRB2 to downstream GEFs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Each protein's activity is appropriately localized: CD80, CD86, and CD28 at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), while GRB2, VAV1, and SOS1 in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. All activities are correctly placed in the context of T cell activation (GO:0042110) or T cell costimulation (GO:0031295) biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes appropriate evidence for each assertion:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Most relationships are supported by experimental evidence codes such as ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) or ECO:0000304 (author statement supported by traceable reference).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Key references include PMID:24845157 for CD80/CD86-CD28 interactions and PMID:7539782 for CD28-GRB2-GEF connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. All assertions include appropriate provenance information.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I've identified a few areas that could be enhanced:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pathway Completion**: The model stops at the GEF activities of VAV1 and SOS1. It could be extended to show activation of small GTPases (RAS/RAC) and subsequent MAPK cascade activation, which would complete the signaling pathway to its nuclear effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Detailed Mechanism for CD28-GRB2 Interaction**: The model could be enhanced by including the phosphorylation step of CD28 at Tyr-191, which creates the binding site for GRB2's SH2 domain. This is a critical mechanistic detail for this pathway as documented in UniProt (PMID:7568038).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **PI3K Pathway Branch**: The model currently focuses on the RAS activation branch of CD28 signaling. Adding the parallel PI3K pathway (which is also activated by CD28-GRB2 interactions) would provide a more complete picture of CD28 costimulation effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It uses the appropriate molecular function terms for each protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Activities are properly connected using recommended causal relationship terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Activities are appropriately contextualized with cellular component terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Each assertion is supported by appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The model follows the GO-CAM guidance for representing signaling pathways, particularly in how it handles adaptor proteins like GRB2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model (gomodel:662af8fa00002332) accurately represents the CD28/GRB2 axis leading to RAS activation in human T cells. It successfully captures the key steps in this important co-stimulatory pathway and adheres to GO-CAM best practices. The model could be enhanced by extending it to include downstream effects and by adding more mechanistic details about protein interactions, particularly the phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of GRB2 to CD28.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model provides a valuable resource for understanding T cell costimulation through CD28 and how it leads to activation of guanyl-nucleotide exchange factors that ultimately activate RAS signaling.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Model Summary\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the molecular pathway of non-canonical inflammasome activation, specifically focused on mouse Caspase-11 (Casp11), its interaction with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the resulting activation of Gasdermin D (Gsdmd) leading to blood-brain barrier breakdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures the following key steps:\n",
      "1. Lipid-binding activity of Casp11 recognizing LPS\n",
      "2. Cysteine-type endopeptidase activity of Casp11 (occurring in cytosol)\n",
      "3. Cleavage of Gasdermin D by Casp11\n",
      "4. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding by Gsdmd\n",
      "5. Formation of pores in the plasma membrane by Gsdmd (wide pore channel activity)\n",
      "6. The resulting pyroptotic cell death in endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier\n",
      "\n",
      "### Literature Support\n",
      "The model is well-supported by recent scientific literature, particularly:\n",
      "- PMID:38632402 (2024) - Clearly establishes the role of GSDMD in blood-brain barrier breakdown during inflammatory conditions\n",
      "- PMID:27339137 (2016) - Explains the mechanism of Gasdermin-D p30 fragment forming pores in membranes\n",

      "\n",
      "### Accuracy of Relationships\n",
      "The causal relationships modeled accurately reflect the current scientific understanding of the pathway:\n",
      "1. Casp11 binds LPS through its lipid binding activity (GO:0008289)\n",
      "2. This binding triggers Casp11's cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004197)\n",
      "3. Active Casp11 cleaves Gsdmd, which leads to Gsdmd binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (GO:0005546)\n",
      "4. This enables Gsdmd to form membrane pores (GO:0022829) at the plasma membrane\n",
      "5. The pore formation results in pyroptotic cell death (GO:0141201)\n",

      "### GO Term Usage \n",
      "The GO terms used appear appropriate for the activities represented:\n",
      "- GO:0008289 (lipid binding) - correctly used for Casp11 binding to LPS\n",
      "- GO:0004197 (cysteine-type endopeptidase activity) - appropriate for Casp11 protease activity\n",

      "\n",
      "### Model Structure\n",
      "The model follows the causal flow of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway correctly. The annotations connect activities in a logical sequence that matches the molecular mechanism described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Protein Annotation\n",
      "- MGI:MGI:107700 (Casp4 Mmus) - This appears to be correctly used to represent mouse Caspase-11, though it's labeled as Casp4. Note that mouse Casp11 is the ortholog of human CASP4/5.\n",
      "- MGI:MGI:1916396 (Gsdmd Mmus) - Correctly used for mouse Gasdermin D\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issue 1: Taxon Mismatch\n",
      "While the title specifies \"Mouse\" model, the taxon is set to NCBITaxon:9606 (Human). This should be corrected to NCBITaxon:10090 (Mouse).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issue 2: Possible Clarification of Casp11 Cleavage of Gsdmd\n",
      "The model correctly shows Casp11 cleaving Gsdmd, but could potentially benefit from explicitly representing the cleavage site (Asp276 in mouse Gsdmd) and the resulting N-terminal fragment that forms the pore.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issue 3: Missing Input Relationship\n",
      "The \"has input\" relationship for Casp11's endopeptidase activity should include Gsdmd as the substrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issue 4: LPS Origin\n",
      "The model could benefit from clarifying whether the LPS is cytosolic (from bacterial infection) or circulating (as in sepsis), as the 2024 paper (PMID:38632402) specifically discusses both scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model captures a contemporary understanding of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway and its role in blood-brain barrier breakdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The causal relationships are properly constructed to show the sequence of molecular events from LPS sensing to pyroptosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The use of appropriate GO terms and evidence codes with relevant PMIDs provides strong scientific support.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The model correctly represents the dual activities of Casp11 (LPS binding and protease) and Gsdmd (lipid binding and pore formation).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a high-quality model that accurately represents the mechanism of non-canonical inflammasome activation by Casp11 upon LPS binding and the downstream effects on Gsdmd activation leading to blood-brain barrier breakdown. The minor issues noted do not significantly impact the scientific accuracy of the model but could be addressed to further improve clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model conforms well to GO-CAM best practices, particularly in how it handles the activities of individual proteins rather than representing the entire inflammasome complex, which is appropriate given that the specific activities of the individual proteins (Casp11 and Gsdmd) are known and documented in the literature.\n",

      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper activity connections**: The model correctly uses the causal predicate \"RO:0002629\" (directly positively regulates) to connect sequential activities in the pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **No annotation for GSDMD cleavage site**: The model does not explicitly annotate the cleavage of GSDMD by CASP4, which occurs at Asp275. This could be explicitly represented to enhance the model's detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing inflammatory mediator release**: The model focuses on pyroptosis but does not include the release of inflammatory mediators like IL-1β and IL-18 through GSDMD pores, which is an important consequence of this pathway. The GSDMD-mediated release of these cytokines contributes significantly to inflammation.\n",

      "4. **Regulation not shown**: The model does not show regulation of this pathway, such as inhibition mechanisms (e.g., by OspC3 from Shigella as described in PMID:34671164).\n",

      "2. **Post-translational Modifications**: The inclusion of ZDHHC3-mediated palmitoylation of DR4 represents an important regulatory mechanism well-supported by literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subcellular Localization**: The model correctly includes subcellular localization information, which is crucial for understanding the mechanism of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence Quality**: The model uses high-quality evidence with appropriate ECO codes, primarily based on direct assays (ECO:0000314) and author statements with traceable support (ECO:0000303).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Death Domain Interactions**: Consider adding more detail about the specific death domain interactions between DR4, TRADD, and FADD, as these are critical for DISC formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Caspase-8 Activation**: The model could be extended to show caspase-8 activation and its downstream effects, including the cleavage of effector caspases like caspase-3.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Membrane Dynamics**: Given the importance of rafts in DR4 signaling, consider adding information about the role of membrane dynamics in TRAIL-DR4 signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Regulatory Mechanisms**: Consider adding inhibitory mechanisms or feedback loops that regulate this pathway, such as FLIP inhibition of caspase-8 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Functions**: All activities are correctly assigned with appropriate GO terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal Relationships**: The \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) relationship is properly used throughout the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Codes**: Appropriate evidence codes with PMIDs are provided for each assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Components**: Proper localization is provided for each activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Biological Process Context**: All activities are correctly assigned to the \"TRAIL-activated apoptotic signaling pathway\" (GO:0036462).\n",

      "This GO-CAM model describes a mechanism by which HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) promotes immune evasion by inhibiting the STING-mediated antiviral immune response. The model shows how Vif acts as a molecular adaptor to recruit the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN6 (SHP-1) to inhibit STING1 activity, thereby suppressing type I interferon production.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Model Structure and Connectivity:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model presents five connected activities:\n",
      "1. **FRK kinase activity** - activates Vif adaptor protein\n",
      "2. **Vif adaptor activity** - recruits PTPN6 (SHP-1)\n",
      "3. **PTPN6 phosphatase activity** - dephosphorylates STING\n",

      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows best practices for annotating molecular adaptors:\n",
      "1. Correctly uses the 'protein-macromolecule adaptor activity' term for Vif\n",
      "2. Appropriately uses 'provides input for' to connect Vif adaptor activity to PTPN6 phosphatase activity\n",

      "1. HIV-1 Vif inhibits type I interferon production\n",
      "2. FRK phosphorylates Vif's ITIM motif\n",
      "3. Phosphorylated Vif recruits PTPN6 (SHP-1)\n",
      "4. PTPN6 dephosphorylates STING at Tyr162\n",
      "5. This inhibits STING's K63-linked ubiquitination at Lys337\n",
      "6. This suppresses STING-mediated innate immune responses\n",
      "\n",
      "The model has effectively captured this mechanism using appropriate GO terms and relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",

      "1. **Complete the signaling cascade**: The model could be extended to include IRF3 activation and type I interferon production downstream of TBK1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add specific phosphorylation sites**: While the model captures the key activities, it could be enhanced by including specific details about the phosphorylation sites (e.g., Vif ITIM phosphorylation by FRK and STING Tyr162 dephosphorylation by PTPN6).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include ubiquitination**: The model could include the K63-linked ubiquitination of STING at Lys337, which is inhibited by PTPN6-mediated dephosphorylation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Include details on FRK inhibition**: The Wang et al. paper mentions that FRK inhibitor D-65495 can block Vif phosphorylation, which could be an interesting regulatory aspect to include.\n",

      "## Review Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the oxidative phosphorylation process in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* (fission yeast), focusing on the electron transport chain components and their relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate use of protein complexes**: The model correctly represents respiratory chain complexes II, III, and IV using ComplexPortal IDs and lists all constituent subunits as members, following the best practices for complex annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct molecular functions**: Each complex or protein is assigned the appropriate molecular function:\n",
      "   - Complex II (CPX-566): electron transfer activity (GO:0009055)\n",
      "   - Complex III (CPX-9308): ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase activity (GO:0008121)\n",
      "   - Complex IV (CPX-9641): cytochrome-c oxidase activity (GO:0004129)\n",
      "   - NADH dehydrogenase (ndi1): NADH dehydrogenase activity (GO:0008137)\n",
      "   - Cytochrome c (cyc1): electron transfer activity (GO:0009055)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct cellular localization**: Components are appropriately placed in mitochondrial compartments:\n",
      "   - Complexes II, III, IV: mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743)\n",
      "   - NADH dehydrogenase: mitochondrial matrix (GO:0005759)\n",
      "   - Cytochrome c: mitochondrial intermembrane space (GO:0005758)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The model captures the flow of electrons through the respiratory chain using the \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) predicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incomplete evidence for some causal associations**: I noticed several causal associations have no evidence annotations:\n",
      "   - The link from complex II to complex III\n",
      "   - The first link from cytochrome c to complex IV\n",
      "   - The link from complex II to cytochrome c\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Redundant causal associations**: There are duplicate causal assertions between some components:\n",
      "   - Two identical causal associations from complex III to cytochrome c\n",
      "   - Two identical causal associations from cytochrome c to complex IV\n",
      "   \n",
      "   This redundancy may make the model less clear and should be eliminated by keeping only one well-evidenced association.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing complex I**: While the model includes ndi1 (NADH dehydrogenase), there is no representation of the complete respiratory chain complex I. The comment in the model (\"Add etf1 complex\") suggests additional components are planned to be added.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Model comments suggest incomplete work**: The comments indicate the model is still under development:\n",
      "   - \"Testing how a complex renders. Waiting for the other complexes to build electron transport chain\"\n",
      "   - \"Add etf1 complex\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Accuracy:\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological flow of electrons is generally correct, matching the established path in the electron transport chain:\n",
      "1. NADH dehydrogenase (ndi1) → Complex II\n",
      "2. Complex II → Complex III (though there's also a direct link to cytochrome c which may be redundant)\n",
      "3. Complex III → cytochrome c\n",
      "4. cytochrome c → Complex IV\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological processes are also correctly annotated for each activity:\n",
      "- ndi1: mitochondrial electron transport, NADH to ubiquinone (GO:0006120)\n",
      "- Complex III: mitochondrial electron transport, ubiquinol to cytochrome c (GO:0006122)\n",
      "- Complex IV: mitochondrial electron transport, cytochrome c to oxygen (GO:0006123)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove redundant causal links**: Eliminate duplicate causal assertions between components.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add evidence to all causal associations**: Ensure all causal links have appropriate evidence annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complete the model**: Add the ETF1 complex as mentioned in the comments, and consider adding ATP synthase (Complex V) to complete the oxidative phosphorylation pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clean up comments**: Once development is complete, update or remove the comments that indicate the model is still under development.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Clarify the role of complex II**: In the standard electron transport chain, NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) typically leads to ubiquinone, which then interacts with Complex III, while Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) is a separate input to ubiquinone. The current model shows ndi1 providing input to Complex II, which may need to be revisited for biological accuracy.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "This model represents pyroptotic cell death mediated by GSDMD (Gasdermin D) and NINJ1 (Ninjurin-1) in humans. Pyroptosis is a form of inflammatory programmed cell death characterized by cell swelling, membrane pore formation, and eventual plasma membrane rupture, leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines and cellular contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Well-supported by evidence**: The model cites multiple recent publications as evidence for each association, enhancing its reliability. The literature referenced includes key papers about NINJ1's role in plasma membrane rupture during pyroptotic cell death.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clear pathway depiction**: The model effectively captures the sequential steps in pyroptotic cell death, from caspase-1 activation to GSDMD pore formation to NINJ1-mediated membrane rupture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate use of causal connections**: The model correctly uses the `RO:0002629` (directly positively regulates) predicate to connect activities in the cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Correct cellular locations**: All activities are assigned appropriate cellular locations (cytosol for caspase, plasma membrane for GSDMD and NINJ1).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Correct integration of recent research**: The model accurately reflects recent discoveries about NINJ1's role in the final stage of pyroptosis (plasma membrane rupture), which was only elucidated in detail in recent years (2021-2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing input molecules**: While the model shows CASP1 with cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, it doesn't include the upstream inflammasome activation that triggers CASP1 activity. Including this would provide more context about what initiates this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete molecular mechanism details**: The model correctly identifies that phosphatidylinositol binding activities are important for GSDMD function, but could benefit from including details about GSDMD cleavage by CASP1 to generate the active N-terminal fragment, which is mentioned in the literature you provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Absent interleukin release**: The literature indicates that the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18 occurs through GSDMD pores, which happens before complete membrane rupture. This could be included as an additional outcome or process in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing regulation by other proteins**: The studies on NINJ1 mention potential regulatory factors and conditions that affect its function, which could be added to provide a more complete picture.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**Recommendations for improvement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add the upstream inflammasome activation that triggers CASP1 activity, possibly including NLRP3, ASC, and other relevant components.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Explicitly represent the cleavage of GSDMD by CASP1 to generate the active N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Include the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18 through GSDMD pores as an outcome or part of the inflammatory response process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider adding details about oligomerization of NINJ1 and GSDMD, as described in the recent structural studies.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the signaling pathway initiated by the interaction between TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, UniProtKB:P50591) and its receptor TRAIL-R2 (TNFRSF10B, UniProtKB:O14763), leading to apoptosis through a cascade of molecular events. The model includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TRAIL cytokine activity in the extracellular space\n",
      "2. TRAIL-R2 signaling receptor activity at the plasma membrane\n",
      "3. A cascade of adaptor proteins (TRADD, FADD) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "4. Activation of caspase-8, an effector protease that mediates apoptosis\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### GO-CAM Structure and Connectivity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model properly represents a causal chain of molecular activities with appropriate causal relationships (RO:0002629, \"directly positively regulates\") between:\n",
      "- TRAIL (cytokine activity) → TRAIL-R2 (signaling receptor activity)\n",
      "- TRAIL-R2 → TRADD (protein-macromolecule adaptor activity)\n",
      "- TRADD → FADD (protein-macromolecule adaptor activity)\n",
      "- FADD → caspase-8 (cysteine-type endopeptidase activity)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "Each activity and causal relationship is supported by experimental evidence with appropriate ECO codes and literature references. The model uses:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- ECO:0000303 (author statement without traceable support)\n",
      "- ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence)\n",
      "\n",
      "References include key papers on TRAIL signaling, with primary citations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Molecular Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "The molecular functions assigned to each protein in the model are accurate:\n",
      "- TRAIL (P50591): GO:0005125 (cytokine activity) - This is correct as TRAIL is a cytokine that binds to death receptors.\n",
      "- TRAIL-R2 (O14763): GO:0038023 (signaling receptor activity) - This is appropriate as TRAIL-R2 is a transmembrane receptor that initiates apoptotic signaling.\n",
      "- TRADD (Q15628): GO:0030674 (protein-macromolecule adaptor activity) - TRADD is indeed an adaptor protein that connects TRAIL-R2 to downstream signaling components.\n",
      "- FADD (Q13158): GO:0030674 (protein-macromolecule adaptor activity) - FADD acts as an adaptor that recruits caspase-8.\n",
      "- Caspase-8 (Q14790): GO:0004197 (cysteine-type endopeptidase activity) - This is the correct enzymatic activity of caspase-8.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Subcellular Locations\n",
      "\n",
      "The locations specified for each activity are biologically accurate:\n",
      "- TRAIL activity occurs in GO:0005615 (extracellular space)\n",
      "- TRAIL-R2 is located at GO:0005886 (plasma membrane)\n",
      "- TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8 activities occur in GO:0005737 (cytoplasm)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Process Context\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are properly associated with GO:0036462 (TRAIL-activated apoptotic signaling pathway), which is the correct biological process term for this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Comparison with Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, the model appropriately represents individual protein activities rather than complex entities. Each protein is annotated with its specific molecular function, and the causal relationships between activities form a coherent signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Missing Elements or Potential Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is well-constructed, I've identified a few aspects that could be improved or expanded:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mechanism of FADD-Caspase-8 Interaction**: The model shows FADD directly activating caspase-8, but it could more explicitly represent the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). The literature (PMID:16762833) indicates that FADD recruits caspase-8 through homotypic death effector domain (DED) interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Caspase-8 Activation Details**: The model could include the self-cleavage and dimerization of caspase-8 that is required for its activation. This is an important regulatory step in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream Apoptotic Execution**: The model could be extended to include downstream targets of caspase-8, such as effector caspases (caspase-3, caspase-7) or BID, which links the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Regulatory Influences**: The model doesn't represent negative regulators of this pathway, such as FLIP (CFLAR), which can compete with caspase-8 for binding to FADD.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence used in the model is appropriate and comes from reliable sources. The model integrates information from multiple papers that have characterized different aspects of the TRAIL signaling pathway. The papers cited (PMID:21146232, PMID:9485194, etc.) are relevant to the interactions represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend the following enhancements to improve this model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Include the intermediate step of DISC formation between receptor activation and caspase-8 recruitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add the self-processing and oligomerization of caspase-8 as a regulatory step.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Extend the model to include at least one downstream effector of caspase-8 (e.g., caspase-3 activation).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider adding regulatory elements such as FLIP or IAPs that modulate the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Include cross-talk with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the caspase-8-mediated cleavage of BID.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the core components of the TRAIL/TRAIL-R2 apoptotic signaling pathway. The model follows GO-CAM best practices by representing individual molecular activities and their causal relationships, supported by appropriate evidence. The suggested improvements would enhance the biological completeness of the model but are not critical deficiencies. This model provides a useful representation of TRAIL-induced apoptotic signaling for the GO-CAM knowledge base.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model represents the phosphatidylinositol phosphate/phosphatidylinositol biosynthetic process (GO:0006661/GO:0043647) in fission yeast (*Schizosaccharomyces pombe*). The model illustrates the enzyme activities and pathway flow involved in inositol phosphate metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Structure and Connectivity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model describes a pathway where:\n",
      "1. Inositol is imported via Itr2 (PomBase:SPAC20G8.03), a myo-inositol:proton symporter\n",
      "2. CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase activity by Pis1 (PomBase:SPAC1D4.08) generates phosphatidylinositol\n",
      "3. Stt4 (PomBase:SPBC577.06c) acts as a 1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase to generate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate\n",
      "4. Further phosphorylation by Its3 (PomBase:SPAC19G12.14) generates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate\n",
      "5. Plc1 (PomBase:SPAC22F8.11) acts as a phospholipase C that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate\n",
      "6. Arg82 (PomBase:SPAC607.04) is an inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase that phosphorylates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate\n",
      "7. Ipk1 (PomBase:SPCC4B3.10c) acts as an inositol-1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase\n",
      "8. Kcs1 (PomBase:SPCC970.08) functions as an inositol hexakisphosphate kinase to generate inositol pyrophosphates\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. **Appropriately represents the key enzymes**: The model includes the major enzymes involved in inositol phosphate metabolism in fission yeast, as supported by literature (specifically PMID:38133430).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Uses correct causal connections**: The model employs RO:0002413 \"provides input for\" appropriately to indicate how substrate output from one reaction serves as input for the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Includes correct subcellular locations**: The model correctly annotates Itr2 and Efr3 as occurring in the plasma membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular mechanisms match literature**: The model's representation of the pathway aligns with the recent publication (PMID:38133430) which describes this pathway's importance in regulating phosphate acquisition genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Efr3-Stt4 relationship**: While the model shows Efr3 (PomBase:SPCC794.08) regulating Stt4, it doesn't clearly explain that Efr3 functions as a protein-membrane adaptor to help localize Stt4 to the plasma membrane. This relationship could be represented more precisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete annotation of compartments**: Several enzymes lack cellular compartment annotations that would enhance the model's accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incomplete representation of final inositol pyrophosphate steps**: Based on the PMID:38133430 reference, the model doesn't fully represent the final steps where Asp1 converts 5-IP7 to 1,5-IP8, which is critical for the biological role of this pathway in phosphate homeostasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing downstream effects**: The model mentions adding \"inositol phosphate metabolic process\" to the components after plc1, but doesn't completely represent how this pathway regulates phosphate acquisition genes (pho1, pho84, and tgp1), which is a key aspect described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Incomplete evidence codes**: Some of the causal associations lack sufficient evidence codes to support the connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add cellular locations**: Add appropriate cellular location annotations for all enzymes in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complete the pathway**: Add the final steps of inositol pyrophosphate metabolism, including Asp1's dual role as a kinase and pyrophosphatase.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include biological outcomes**: Add annotations to represent how this pathway regulates gene expression of the phosphate acquisition genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Improve causal connections**: Review each \"provides input for\" causal connection to ensure all have appropriate evidence codes and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add chemical intermediates**: The model comments mention \"add major intermediates\" - these should be incorporated to better represent the full metabolic pathway and the chemical transformations occurring between steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Clarify Efr3 function**: Better describe how Efr3 acts as a membrane adaptor for Stt4 in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a useful representation of the inositol phosphate biosynthetic pathway in fission yeast. It correctly captures the major enzymatic steps and their causal relationships. However, the model could be improved by adding cellular locations for all activities, completing the final steps of the pathway, adding key intermediates, and showing the biological significance of this pathway in regulating phosphate homeostasis genes.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Overview\n",
      "This model represents canonical glycolysis (GO:0061621) in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. It includes 12 activities that together form a complete glycolytic pathway, with appropriate causal relationships between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Completeness**: The model includes all canonical glycolytic enzymes and their respective activities, from hexokinase (beginning of glycolysis) to pyruvate kinase (end of glycolysis).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causality**: The model correctly uses RO:0002413 (\"provides input for\") to connect the activities in the pathway in the expected sequential order, representing substrate-product relationships.\n",

      "3. **Cellular localization**: All activities are properly annotated as occurring in the cytosol (GO:0005829), which is the expected cellular location for glycolysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence support**: Activities are supported by appropriate evidence codes, including direct assays (ECO:0000314), high throughput assays (ECO:0007005), and computational predictions based on sequence similarity (ECO:0000318, ECO:0000250).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Literature references**: The model cites relevant literature such as PMID:8549830 (characterizing hexokinases in S. pombe) and PMID:9790887 (pyruvate kinase characterization).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing chemical inputs/outputs**: While the model does have inputs and outputs for some activities (e.g., hexokinase has D-hexose input, and pyruvate kinase has pyruvate output), most of the intermediate reactions are missing inputs and outputs. Adding these would improve the comprehensiveness of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Redundant causal associations**: There are several instances of duplicate causal associations between the same activities. For example:\n",
      "   - Activity 663d668500002302/663d668500002432 (triose-phosphate isomerase) has multiple redundant causal connections to the same downstream activities.\n",
      "   - Activity 663d668500002302/663d668500002422 (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase) has duplicate causal connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Empty evidence fields**: Some causal associations have empty evidence fields, which should be populated with appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Comment indicating incompleteness**: The model has a comment stating \"To do, add other input chemicals and activities,\" indicating the curator's awareness that the model remains incomplete.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Branch point representation**: Glycolysis has a branch point where dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are produced from fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The model doesn't clearly represent this branch point and the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate back to the main pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity ID 663d668500002302/663d668500002441 and 663d668500002302/663d668500002589**: Both of these represent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) (phosphorylating) activity (GO:0004365) enabled by different genes (PomBase:SPBC354.12 and PomBase:SPBC32F12.11). It's unusual to have two separate activities for the same function in a canonical pathway model - this should be reviewed to determine if this represents isozymes and if their inclusion is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Activity ID 663d668500002302/663d668500002626 and 663d668500002302/663d668500002636**: Similarly, there are two enolase activities (GO:0004634) enabled by different genes (eno101 and eno102), which should be reviewed to determine if both are required in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inputs and outputs**: Key metabolites should be added as inputs and outputs of each reaction:\n",
      "   - Glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, etc. are missing from most steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete inputs and outputs**: Add all relevant chemical inputs and outputs for each enzymatic step in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Remove redundant causal associations**: Clean up duplicate causal associations between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Address isozymes**: Either justify the inclusion of multiple enzyme isoforms for the same step or simplify to represent the canonical pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add missing evidence**: Ensure all causal associations have appropriate evidence fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Represent the branch point**: Clearly represent the branch at fructose 1,6-bisphosphate where dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are produced, and the subsequent conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the canonical glycolysis pathway in S. pombe, with all key enzymatic activities represented. The activities are properly connected with causal relationships, and most have appropriate evidence and literature support. However, the model could be improved by adding chemical inputs and outputs for all steps, removing redundant causal associations, and addressing the representation of isozymes. Once these issues are addressed, the model will provide a more complete and accurate representation of glycolysis.\n",

      "This GO-CAM represents the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway in humans, showing the interactions between the cytokine TGFB1, the receptors TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, and the downstream effector SMAD2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of 4 main activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **TGFB1 (P01137)** with cytokine activity (GO:0005125) in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "2. **TGFBR2 (P37173)** with TGF-beta receptor type II activity (GO:0005026) at plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "3. **TGFBR1 (P36897)** with TGF-beta receptor type I activity (GO:0005025) at plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "4. **SMAD2 (Q15796)** with DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) in nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents the following causal chain:\n",
      "- TGFB1 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) TGFBR2\n",
      "- TGFBR2 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) TGFBR1\n",
      "- TGFBR1 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) SMAD2\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are part of the GO:0007179 (transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological Accuracy**: The model correctly captures the canonical TGF-beta signaling pathway where the cytokine TGFB1 binds to TGFBR2, which then recruits and phosphorylates TGFBR1, leading to the activation of SMAD2.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence Support**: Each component has appropriate evidence codes and PMID references supporting the annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular Localization**: Appropriate cellular compartments are assigned to each protein, reflecting their known localizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SMAD2 Transcription Factor Activity**:\n",
      "   - The model uses the general term \"DNA-binding transcription factor activity\" (GO:0003700) for SMAD2. According to the DNA-binding transcription factor annotation guidelines, a more specific term should be used, such as \"DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific\" (GO:0001228) which would be more appropriate based on SMAD2's known function.\n",
      "   - The guideline also suggests that each transcriptional target should be captured separately, but no specific targets are indicated in this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing SMAD Complex Formation**:\n",
      "   - SMAD2 typically forms a complex with SMAD4 before translocating to the nucleus and activating transcription. This SMAD2-SMAD4 complex formation is not represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **SMAD Phosphorylation**:\n",
      "   - The activation of SMAD2 by TGFBR1 typically involves phosphorylation of SMAD2 at specific serine residues (Ser465/467), which is an important mechanistic detail that could be included in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional Regulatory Mechanisms**:\n",
      "   - The model doesn't capture negative regulators of the pathway, such as inhibitory SMADs (SMAD7) or phosphatases like PPM1A that dephosphorylate SMAD2.\n",
      "   - It also doesn't include non-SMAD pathways activated by TGF-beta signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Specific Transcriptional Outputs**:\n",
      "   - No specific transcriptional targets of SMAD2 are indicated. According to the DNA-binding transcription factor annotation guidelines, the relationship between the transcription factor and the genes it regulates should be captured with \"has input\" relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model follows the basic GO-CAM format with activities, cellular components, and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The use of the \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) predicate is appropriate for the signaling cascade depicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. All proteins have appropriate molecular functions and cellular components assigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. However, as noted above, the DNA-binding transcription factor activity of SMAD2 could be more specifically annotated following the transcription factor annotation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model provides a good foundation for representing the TGF-beta signaling pathway, but could be enhanced by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using more specific GO terms for SMAD2's transcription factor activity\n",
      "2. Including SMAD4 and the formation of the SMAD2-SMAD4 complex\n",
      "3. Adding specific transcriptional targets of SMAD2 with \"has input\" relationships\n",
      "4. Including additional regulatory mechanisms such as inhibitory SMADs\n",
      "5. Capturing the phosphorylation of SMAD2 by TGFBR1 more explicitly\n",
      "\n",
      "These enhancements would make the model more comprehensive and aligned with the current understanding of TGF-beta signaling and GO-CAM best practices for annotating transcription factors.\n",

      "\n",
      "Each activity and association is supported by experimental evidence, primarily direct assays (ECO:0000314) with references to peer-reviewed publications:\n",

      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing SMAD Complex**: According to literature, SMAD2 typically functions as part of a complex with SMAD4. The model could be enhanced by including SMAD4 and representing this complex formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Transcriptional Target(s)**: Following GO-CAM guidelines for DNA-binding transcription factors, SMAD2 should have one or more specific transcriptional targets using the \"has input\" relationship, with appropriate causal relationships (indirectly positively/negatively regulates).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **SMAD2 Phosphorylation**: The model could explicitly represent the phosphorylation of SMAD2 by TGF-beta receptor type I, as this is a crucial step in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Receptor Complex Formation**: According to the signaling receptor activity guidelines, the model could better represent the formation of the TGF-beta receptor complex (type I and type II receptors).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Downstream Effectors**: The model currently ends with SMAD2 activation. Adding downstream target genes and their biological effects would provide a more complete picture of the pathway.\n",

      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, there are a few improvements that could be made:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Downstream effects of SMAD2**: The model could be extended to show what genes SMAD2 regulates. Currently, SMAD2 is shown as a transcription factor but has no outputs, leaving the pathway incomplete.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **SMAD2/SMAD4 complex**: According to the literature, SMAD2 typically forms a complex with SMAD4 to regulate transcription. This is not represented in the current model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback mechanisms**: The model could include negative feedback loops that regulate TGF-beta signaling (such as inhibitory SMADs or other regulatory proteins).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Phosphorylation status**: The model doesn't capture the important phosphorylation of SMAD2 by TGFBR1, which is a key regulatory mechanism for this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:663d668500003232) is a well-constructed representation of the TGF-beta 3 signaling pathway that follows GO-CAM best practices. The activities are properly connected and supported by evidence. It provides a parsimonious and clear representation of the canonical pathway.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle, in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* (fission yeast, taxon NCBITaxon:4896). The model includes all the major enzymes of the TCA cycle and their molecular functions, with appropriate causal connections between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete Pathway Representation**: The model captures all essential enzymes of the TCA cycle:\n",
      "   - Citrate synthase (cit1)\n",
      "   - Aconitase (aco1, aco2)\n",
      "   - Isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh1, idh2)\n",
      "   - α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (kgd1, kgd2, kgd4, dld1)\n",
      "   - Succinyl-CoA ligase (sca1, lsc2)\n",
      "   - Succinate dehydrogenase complex (sdh1, sdh2, sdh3, tim18)\n",
      "   - Fumarate hydratase (fum1)\n",
      "   - Malate dehydrogenase (mdh1)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper Subcellular Localization**: Appropriate mitochondrial locations are specified (GO:0005739, GO:0005759, GO:0005743).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Connectivity**: Activities are connected using RO:0002413 (*provides input for*), creating a coherent representation of the cycle's reaction sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate Molecular Functions**: Each enzyme is annotated with the correct molecular function term.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Adaptor Protein Annotation**: KGD4 is correctly represented as having a protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674), following the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Molecular Inputs/Outputs**: While some activities have inputs and outputs (e.g., dihydrolipoamide for dld1, succinyl-CoA for sca1 and lsc2), many activities are missing their explicit chemical inputs/outputs, which would make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Duplicate Causal Associations**: Several activities have duplicate causal associations with the same predicate and target. For example:\n",
      "   - kgd4 has duplicate associations to kgd1 and kgd2\n",
      "   - Multiple activities have both evidenced and non-evidenced causal associations to the same targets\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incomplete Evidence**: Some activities have connections without evidence annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Redundant Connections**: There are multiple causal paths from some activities to others. For example, aco2 has three identical causal connections to idh1 and idh2.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Comment Clarity**: The comment about \"directons, particularly fumerate hydratase /dehydratase\" contains a typo (\"directons\" should be \"directions\") and is unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Technical Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **KGD4 Complex Annotations**: The comment about KGD4 indicates it functions as an adaptor protein in the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, which is correctly represented. However, the causal associations from kgd4 to both kgd1 and kgd2 use RO:0012009 instead of a more specific term that would clarify its role in stabilizing the complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Respiratory Chain Complex II**: The electron transfer from SDH to ubiquinone (GO:0006121) is included, but could be better integrated with the main TCA cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **ACO2 Annotation**: The comment \"aco2 is TCA in S. cerevisiae when glucose is limiting\" is present in the model, but this statement is about S. cerevisiae while the model represents S. pombe. This may be confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Missing Chemical Inputs/Outputs**: For each enzymatic reaction, include all relevant chemical inputs and outputs to fully represent the transformations in the TCA cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Remove Duplicate Associations**: Clean up duplicate causal associations that have the same predicate and target.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add Evidence for All Assertions**: Ensure all causal connections have appropriate evidence annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarify Comments**: Revise the comment about fumarate hydratase to make it clearer, and ensure all comments are relevant to S. pombe.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Standardize Representation of Complex Subunits**: For the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase complexes, ensure consistent representation of how subunits interact.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the TCA cycle in S. pombe with all essential enzymes and connections. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for complex annotation, particularly with the representation of kgd4 as an adaptor protein. With the suggested improvements, the model would be more precise and informative for users, while maintaining its parsimony and readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is biologically accurate and consistent with standard textbook knowledge of the TCA cycle, with appropriate evidence support from both literature and orthology-based assignments.\n",

      "Based on my review of the GO-CAM model \"GPI anchor biosynthetic process (GO:0006506)\" with ID gomodel:665912ed00000192, here's my assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "## General Review\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor biosynthetic process in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* (fission yeast), which is a complex multi-step pathway involving many enzymes that work sequentially to synthesize GPI anchors for proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive representation**: The model includes many of the key enzymes involved in GPI anchor biosynthesis, with appropriate molecular functions assigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper cellular locations**: The activities are correctly localized to appropriate cellular components (endoplasmic reticulum membrane, ER, GPI-anchor transamidase complex, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal connections**: Most activities are properly connected with causal relationships using the appropriate \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) predicate to show the sequential steps in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes, with a mix of experimental evidence, sequence similarity, and orthology-based annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues Identified\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Duplicate causal relationships**: There are several instances where the same causal relationship is represented twice between the same activities. For example:\n",
      "   - In activity `gomodel:665912ed00000192/665912ed00000210`, there are two identical causal associations to activity `665912ed00000232`\n",
      "   - In activity `gomodel:665912ed00000192/665912ed00000396`, there are duplicate causal associations to activity `665912ed00000193`\n",
      "   - Several other activities have this same issue throughout the model\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex representation**: The model comment mentions \"deal with 2 complexes once in complex portal,\" but it's not clear if this has been addressed. Based on the GO-CAM guidelines for representing complexes, these should be properly annotated according to whether the subunit carrying the activity is known or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing molecular functions**: Some activities have `GO:0003674` (molecular function) assigned, which is the root term for all molecular functions, indicating that the specific function is not known. While this is acceptable when the function is truly unknown, it should be reviewed to ensure more specific terms aren't available.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Unused inputs and outputs**: Some activities like `gomodel:665912ed00000192/665912ed00000427` have inputs defined (CHEBI:16749) but this input is listed twice. Activity `gomodel:665912ed00000192/66c7d41500001900` has an output defined but isn't clearly connected to the rest of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Lack of regulation clarity**: The model shows several regulatory relationships (using RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\") but the mechanism of this regulation isn't always clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove duplicate causal associations**: Clean up the model by removing duplicate causal relationships between the same activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify complex representation**: According to the best practices document, if subunits carrying specific activities are known, they should be represented directly. If not, use the complex ID. The comment about handling complexes should be addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Review molecular function annotations**: For activities with `GO:0003674`, consider if more specific molecular function terms could be applied based on recent literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connect isolated activities**: Ensure all activities, especially those with defined inputs/outputs like activity `66c7d41500001900` (pis1), are properly connected to the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Verify evidence for regulatory relationships**: Ensure that all regulatory relationships have appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Update comment**: Once the issue with the complexes is resolved, the comment \"deal with 2 complexes once in complex portal\" should be updated or removed to reflect the current state of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",

      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "1. **Pathway Completeness**: The model represents a comprehensive view of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthetic pathway, including multiple sequential steps with appropriate enzymes.\n",
      "2. **Cellular Context**: Activities are properly annotated with cellular locations, primarily occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (GO:0005789).\n",

      "2. **Missing Activity**: The comment mentions \"waiting for correct activity for dfg10\" - I see dfg10 (PomBase:SPAC7D4.09c) is annotated with 3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase activity (GO:0003865), but this may not be the most appropriate activity term based on its role in dolichol biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Duplicate Activities**: There are duplicate activities for some proteins, such as:\n",
      "   - PomBase:SPBC11B10.01 (alg2) has two activities: GO:0004378 and GO:0102704\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Input/Output Molecules**: While some activities have specified input/output molecules, there are inconsistencies:\n",

      "   - Some molecular inputs and outputs are missing for key steps in the pathway\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ambiguous Causal Relationships**: Several activities have multiple downstream connections to the same activity, which may create confusion in pathway interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Uncertain Evidence**: Some associations have no evidence codes specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete Missing Connections**:\n",
      "   - Connect sec59 (SPCC63.10c), dfg10 (SPAC7D4.09c), and rer2 (SPAC4D7.04c) as mentioned in the comments to show the proper flow of the dolichol biosynthetic process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Resolve Duplicate Activities**:\n",
      "   - For molecules with multiple activities, determine whether these are indeed separate functions or redundant annotations, and connect them appropriately in the pathway.\n",
      "   - For example, clarify whether alg2 (SPBC11B10.01) performs both GDP-Man:Man1GlcNAc2-PP-Dol alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase and GDP-Man:Man2GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase activities sequentially or in different contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add Missing Input/Output Molecules**:\n",
      "   - Ensure all activities have their relevant input and output molecules specified to better illustrate the flow of material through the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarify Causal Relationships**:\n",
      "   - Review cases where multiple causal connections point to the same downstream activity and determine if these represent alternative pathways, redundancy, or modeling errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complete Evidence Documentation**:\n",
      "   - Add appropriate evidence codes for any associations currently lacking them.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Review Activity for dfg10**:\n",
      "   - Confirm the appropriate molecular function for dfg10 (SPAC7D4.09c). The current annotation with 3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase activity may need revision based on its role in dolichol biosynthesis.\n",

      "The overall biological process represented appears accurate, modeling the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthetic pathway in fission yeast, which is a conserved pathway involved in N-linked glycosylation. The sequential arrangement of enzymes follows the known steps of this pathway, moving from early glycosylation with N-acetylglucosamine to later additions of mannose and glucose residues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model connects many of the key enzymes involved including the ALG family proteins (ALG1, ALG2, ALG3, etc.) that sequentially build the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. The inclusion of dolichol biosynthesis components (dfg10, rer2, sec59) is also biologically appropriate, as dolichol phosphate is a key substrate in this pathway.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthetic process in S. pombe. While the model has several strengths in terms of pathway coverage and evidence support, there are areas that need improvement, particularly in connecting dolichol biosynthesis to the main pathway, resolving duplicate activities, and ensuring consistent annotation of molecular inputs and outputs. Addressing these issues would improve the model's clarity and biological accuracy.\n",

      "1. RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation (siRNA pathway)\n",
      "2. Histone modification activities (methylation, deacetylation)\n",
      "3. Heterochromatin protein complexes (CLRC, SHREC, RITS, etc.)\n",
      "4. RNA processing machineries\n",
      "\n",
      "## Structural Assessment\n",
      "\n",

      "1. **RNAi Machinery**: The model includes Dcr1 (Dicer), Ago1 (Argonaute), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Rdp1, which are essential components of the RNAi pathway that initiates heterochromatin formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Histone Modifications**: The model correctly shows Clr4 as the H3K9 methyltransferase and includes deacetylases (Clr3, Sir2) that remove acetyl groups from histones to facilitate heterochromatin formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Heterochromatin Proteins**: The model includes HP1 homologs (Swi6, Chp2) that bind methylated H3K9 and contribute to heterochromatin spreading and maintenance.\n",

      "The model [gomodel:665912ed00001983](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:665912ed00001983) describes the process of subtelomeric heterochromatin formation in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (NCBITaxon:4896). The model captures multiple activities involved in this complex process, including RNA processing, histone modification, protein binding, adaptor activities, and regulatory relationships between these components.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive coverage**: The model effectively captures multiple molecular pathways involved in heterochromatin formation, including both RNAi-dependent and RNAi-independent mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-evidenced**: Most activities and relationships are supported by appropriate experimental evidence with clear literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate cellular components**: The model correctly localizes activities to their cellular compartments (e.g., RITS complex, SHREC complex, CLRC complex).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clear activity flow**: The model generally depicts a logical flow of activities showing how different proteins contribute to heterochromatin formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Duplicate causal associations**: Several activities have duplicate causal associations with the same predicate and downstream activity:\n",
      "   - Activity gomodel:665912ed00001983/665912ed00002048 (enabled by raf1) has two identical causal associations to activity gomodel:665912ed00001983/665912ed00001995 (enabled by clr4) using RO:0002304\n",

      "\n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Remove duplicate causal associations, keeping only one instance with the strongest evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing molecular function terms**: Several activities use \"GO:0003674\" (molecular_function) rather than specific molecular function terms:\n",
      "   - Activities enabled by rss1, cul4, raf1, rik1, clr1, clr2, and rad25\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Replace generic molecular function terms with more specific terms based on literature evidence when available.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback loops**: The model shows several feedback relationships but should clarify the temporal sequence of events, especially between:\n",
      "   - SHREC complex components\n",
      "   - RITS complex and RNAi machinery\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Consider adding annotations to clarify temporal sequence and the biological context of feedback regulation.\n",

      "   - The causal association between lsd1/lsd2 activities and sir2 activity is based on genetic interaction evidence\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **Recommendation**: For associations based on genetic evidence, consider adding notes to clarify that these may represent indirect rather than direct relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Molecular adaptor annotations**: The model contains a protein with annotated adaptor activity (stc1, GO:0030674). According to GO-CAM best practices, adaptor proteins should follow the guidelines in the \"How to annotate molecular adaptors\" document.\n",
      "   \n",

The model includes multiple molecular functions and causal relationships that form the pathway of nitrogen metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model effectively captures the urea cycle and related nitrogen metabolism pathways, representing the relationships between different enzyme activities and metabolites.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incomplete evidence for some causal relationships**: Several causal associations lack evidence codes, including:\n",

      "   \n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Remove duplicate metabolite entries to avoid redundancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Consistency of activity representation**: The model transitions between representing a pathway via sequential activities and via a more direct process, which can be confusing. For example, some parts show detailed step-by-step enzymatic reactions while others have more direct connections.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   **Recommendation**: Maintain a consistent level of granularity throughout the model where possible, or clearly delineate different subpathways.\n",

      "## Biological Content Validation\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological content of the model is largely consistent with the literature regarding urea cycle and nitrogen metabolism in *S. pombe*. The key paper [PMID:24177583](https://bioregistry.io/PMID:24177583) by Kinghorn and Fluri (1984) confirms the roles of uricase, allantoinase, allantoicase, and urease activities in the purine degradation pathway leading to nitrogen release.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly represents these enzymes and their relationships. For example, the paper describes the ure1, ure2, ure3, and ure4 genes as encoding components of urease, which is consistent with the model's representation of urease activity.\n",

It effectively represents the biological knowledge from the literature and mostly follows GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model would benefit from the addition of missing evidence codes, removal of redundancies, and more consistent representation of inputs and outputs. Additionally, clarifying the role of the CHEBI-enabled activity would improve the model's clarity and adherence to GO-CAM standards.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The model titled \"CD93/Multimerin-2/β1 integrin complex function in angiogenesis (Human)\" represents the molecular interactions between three key proteins:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **MMRN2 (Multimerin-2)** - An extracellular matrix protein with receptor ligand activity\n",
      "2. **CD93** - A C-type lectin domain receptor with signaling receptor activity\n",
      "3. **ITGB1 (Integrin β1)** - A coreceptor that functions in angiogenesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts how these proteins interact in the context of angiogenesis in humans, showing causal relationships between their molecular functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientific basis for this model is well-supported by current literature. Recent studies, particularly by Khan et al. (2017), have established that Multimerin-2 (MMRN2) is a ligand for CD93, which is a member of the group 14 family of C-type lectins. These interactions have been shown to be important in angiogenesis. \n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows MMRN2 located in the extracellular space (GO:0005615) with receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018), which is consistent with its known function as a secreted ECM protein. CD93 is shown on the plasma membrane (GO:0005886) with signaling receptor activity (GO:0038023), which aligns with its established role. ITGB1 is also correctly placed on the plasma membrane with coreceptor activity (GO:0015026).\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships showing MMRN2 directly positively regulating (RO:0002629) CD93, and CD93 directly positively regulating ITGB1 are supported by the literature. Evidence from the Khan et al. study demonstrates that MMRN2 binds to CD93, and these proteins are both involved in angiogenesis (GO:0001525). Additional evidence suggests ITGB1 functions in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and GO-CAM Standards\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM standards for representing molecular activities and causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Each activity is correctly enabled by a single gene product\n",
      "2. Activities are appropriately localized to cellular compartments\n",
      "3. Activities are placed in the context of the biological process of angiogenesis\n",
      "4. Causal relationships are represented with the correct predicates (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates)\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is a duplication in the model that needs to be corrected:\n",
      "\n",
      "- MMRN2's receptor ligand activity (gomodel:666b894f00000196/666b894f00000197) has two identical causal associations to CD93's signaling receptor activity (gomodel:666b894f00000196/666b894f00000204) using the same predicate (RO:0002629). This is redundant and one of these relationships should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Supporting Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "The model cites appropriate evidence codes and literature references:\n",
      "\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) is used with various PMIDs\n",
      "- Key references include PMID:28671670, which establishes the MMRN2-CD93 interaction\n",
      "- Other citations (PMID:11559704, PMID:31138217, etc.) provide supporting evidence for cellular locations and participation in angiogenesis\n",
      "\n",
      "The reference PMID:23125415 provides evidence for ITGB1's coreceptor activity, which is consistent with findings about integrin β1 functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove the duplicate causal relationship**: There are two identical causal associations from MMRN2 to CD93, one of which should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider representing the complex**: Since the document \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" suggests representing complexes when multiple proteins function together, the curator might consider explicitly modeling the CD93/MMRN2/ITGB1 complex if evidence suggests they function as a unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add more molecular detail if available**: If there is evidence for specific signaling events downstream of CD93 activation by MMRN2, these could enrich the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence for the second causal relationship**: The causal association between CD93 and ITGB1 has an empty evidence field in one case. This should be filled with appropriate evidence codes and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"CD93/Multimerin-2/β1 integrin complex function in angiogenesis (Human)\" represents a scientifically accurate pathway based on current literature. It correctly depicts the roles of MMRN2, CD93, and ITGB1 in angiogenesis, with appropriate molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships. \n",
      "\n",
      "With minor corrections (removing the duplicate causal relationship and adding missing evidence), this model will provide a valuable representation of how these three proteins interact in angiogenesis. Overall, the model is well-constructed and follows GO-CAM best practices.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model titled \"AARS1 mediates lactylation of YAP1 and TEAD1, promoting activation of Hippo signaling (Human)\" represents a molecular pathway where AARS1 (alanyl-tRNA synthetase 1) acts as a lactyltransferase to modify YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) and TEAD1 (TEA domain family member 1), leading to activation of Hippo signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes three main activities:\n",
      "1. AARS1 (UniProtKB:P49588) with peptide lactyltransferase activity\n",
      "2. YAP1 (UniProtKB:P46937) with transcription coregulator activity  \n",
      "3. TEAD1 (UniProtKB:P28347) with DNA-binding transcription factor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is based on a recent publication (PMID:38512451) that demonstrates AARS1 can function as a lactyltransferase, using lactate and ATP to catalyze the lactylation of proteins including YAP1 and TEAD1. This lactylation affects the Hippo signaling pathway, promoting YAP1's function as a transcriptional coactivator working with TEAD1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships represented in the model are consistent with the literature:\n",
      "- AARS1's lactyltransferase activity directly positively regulates both YAP1 and TEAD1\n",
      "- YAP1's coregulator activity directly positively regulates TEAD1's transcription factor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "These relationships align with the findings that lactylation of YAP1 at K90 and TEAD1 at K108 promotes YAP1 nuclear localization, enhances YAP1-TEAD1 interaction, and increases the transcriptional activity of this complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Structure and Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "1. Representing protein activities with appropriate GO molecular function terms\n",
      "2. Properly representing the subcellular locations (nucleus for all activities)\n",
      "3. Using appropriate causal relationships between activities (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\")\n",
      "4. Connecting the activities to the correct biological process (GO:0035329 \"hippo signaling\" for YAP1 and TEAD1, and GO:0035332 \"positive regulation of hippo signaling\" for AARS1)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by evidence, with each assertion backed by appropriate reference to the primary literature (PMID:38512451, PMID:18579750, PMID:19324877). The evidence codes used (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) are appropriate for the experimental evidence cited.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed model that accurately captures the relationship between AARS1, YAP1, and TEAD1 in the context of Hippo signaling. However, there are a few potential enhancements that could be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional mechanistic details**: The model could be expanded to include the specific details of how lactylation affects YAP1 function, such as inhibiting its nuclear export or preventing its ubiquitination.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Downstream effects**: The model could be extended to include the downstream target genes of YAP1-TEAD1, such as CTGF, which was identified in the literature as an important mediator of YAP's growth-promoting function.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulatory context**: The model could include upstream regulators that influence AARS1's lactyltransferase activity, such as lactate levels which were shown to promote AARS1 nuclear translocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connection to phenotypic outcomes**: The model could be linked to the biological outcomes of YAP1-TEAD1 activation, such as cell proliferation, EMT, or oncogenic transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the molecular mechanism of AARS1-mediated lactylation of YAP1 and TEAD1 leading to Hippo pathway activation. It is well-supported by recent literature and follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities and their relationships. While there are opportunities to expand the model with additional details, the current representation serves as a solid foundation for understanding this novel regulatory mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly focuses on the \"moonlighting\" function of AARS1 as a lactyltransferase rather than its canonical role in tRNA charging, which is appropriate given the specific biological process being modeled. The causal connections between the activities reflect the positive regulatory relationships described in the literature.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model represents the relationship between SIRT1, YAP1, and TEAD1 proteins in the context of the Hippo signaling pathway, specifically focusing on the post-translational modification of lactylation and its regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components\n",
      "1. **SIRT1** (UniProtKB:Q96EB6): NAD-dependent protein deacetylase/delactylase\n",
      "2. **YAP1** (UniProtKB:P46937): Transcriptional coactivator\n",
      "3. **TEAD1** (UniProtKB:P28347): Transcriptional enhancer factor\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Activities\n",
      "1. **SIRT1** acts as a NAD-dependent protein lysine delactylase (GO:0141208)\n",
      "2. **YAP1** functions as a transcription coregulator (GO:0003712)\n",
      "3. **TEAD1** functions as a DNA-binding transcription factor (GO:0003700)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biological Process Context\n",
      "All activities occur within the Hippo signaling pathway (GO:0035329), with SIRT1 specifically involved in negative regulation of Hippo signaling (GO:0035331).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "1. YAP1 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) TEAD1\n",
      "2. SIRT1 directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) both YAP1 and TEAD1\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Location\n",
      "All activities occur in the nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the recently published research (PMID:38512451), this model captures an important regulatory mechanism of the Hippo signaling pathway through post-translational modification. The key findings are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. YAP1 and TEAD1 can be lactylated at specific lysine residues (K90 for YAP1, K108 for TEAD1)\n",
      "2. Lactylation of these proteins promotes their activity and nuclear localization\n",
      "3. SIRT1 functions as a delactylase that removes the lactyl groups from these proteins\n",
      "4. This delactylation leads to decreased activity of YAP1 and TEAD1, effectively inactivating Hippo signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "This creates a regulatory circuit where:\n",
      "- Lactylation (by AARS1) → Increased YAP1-TEAD1 activity → Increased Hippo signaling target gene expression\n",
      "- Delactylation (by SIRT1) → Decreased YAP1-TEAD1 activity → Decreased Hippo signaling target gene expression\n",
      "\n",
      "## QC Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "1. **Evidence Support**: The model is well-supported by multiple pieces of evidence, including experimental evidence (ECO:0000314) from recent publications.\n",
      "2. **Mechanistic Detail**: The model captures the specific molecular function of SIRT1 as a delactylase.\n",
      "3. **Causal Relationships**: The causal relationships between the proteins are correctly represented, with YAP1 positively regulating TEAD1 and SIRT1 negatively regulating both.\n",
      "4. **Cellular Localization**: All activities are correctly annotated to occur in the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Context for AARS1**: The model only represents the delactylation by SIRT1 but doesn't include the counteracting lactylation mechanism by AARS1, which would provide a more complete picture of the regulatory circuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete Biological Process Representation**: While the activities are connected to the Hippo signaling pathway, downstream effects on specific gene expression or cellular processes (like proliferation or apoptosis) are not included.\n",

The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representation of molecular activities and their connections.\n",

      "Title: \"ANG tRNA ribonuclease activity inhibits translation in response to stress (Human)\"\n",
      "Taxon: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)\n",
      "Status: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Content Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model describes how angiogenin (ANG) acts to inhibit translation in response to stress in human cells. The model includes interactions between:\n",
      "1. Angiogenin (ANG, UniProtKB:P03950)\n",
      "2. Plexin-B2 (PLXNB2, UniProtKB:O15031)\n",
      "3. Cytosolic large ribosomal subunit (GO:0022625)\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures how ANG produces tRNA-derived stress-induced small RNAs (tiRNAs) in response to stress, which inhibit translation, and how this activity is regulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Detailed Model Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Proteins and Molecular Functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Angiogenin (UniProtKB:P03950):\n",
      "- **Activities in the model:**\n",
      "  - tRNA-specific ribonuclease activity (GO:0004549)\n",
      "  - Receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018)\n",
      "- **Appropriately annotated:** Yes, based on the literature evidence. ANG has dual functions: it can act as a ligand for its receptor and cleaves tRNAs when activated.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Plexin-B2 (UniProtKB:O15031):\n",
      "- **Activities in the model:**\n",
      "  - Signaling receptor activity (GO:0038023)\n",
      "  - Ribonuclease inhibitor activity (GO:0008428)\n",
      "- **Appropriately annotated:** Yes, based on the literature provided. Plexin-B2 acts as a receptor for ANG and is involved in mediating ANG endocytosis and translocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Cytosolic large ribosomal subunit (GO:0022625):\n",
      "- **Activities in the model:**\n",
      "  - Structural constituent of ribosome (GO:0003735)\n",
      "  - Ribonuclease inhibitor activity (GO:0008428)\n",
      "- **Appropriately annotated:** Generally yes, but with a potential issue discussed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Biological Processes:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model connects the molecular functions to the appropriate biological processes:\n",
      "- Negative regulation of translation in response to stress (GO:0032055)\n",
      "- Receptor-mediated endocytosis (GO:0006898)\n",
      "- Signal transduction (GO:0007165)\n",
      "- Cytoplasmic translation (GO:0002181)\n",
      "- Cellular response to stress (GO:0033554)\n",
      "\n",
      "These process annotations accurately reflect the biology depicted in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Cellular Components:\n",
      "\n",
      "The cellular locations are well annotated:\n",
      "- Plasma membrane (GO:0005886) for PLXNB2\n",
      "- Cytoplasm (GO:0005737) for ANG\n",
      "- Cytosol (GO:0005829) for ribosomal activity and inhibitor activity\n",
      "- Extracellular space (GO:0005615) for ANG's receptor ligand activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Causal Relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships in the model appear to be correctly depicted:\n",
      "1. ANG's receptor ligand activity positively regulates PLXNB2's signaling receptor activity (RO:0002304)\n",
      "2. PLXNB2's signaling receptor activity positively regulates ribonuclease inhibitor activity (RO:0002629)\n",
      "3. Ribonuclease inhibitor activity positively regulates ANG's tRNA ribonuclease activity (RO:0002629)\n",
      "4. ANG's tRNA ribonuclease activity negatively regulates ribosomal structural activity (RO:0002630)\n",
      "\n",
      "These relationships accurately represent the chain of events from ANG binding to PLXNB2 to the eventual inhibition of translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Protein Complex Representation and Activity Attribution:\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, when the specific subunit carrying an activity is not known, the GO term for the complex should be used. In this model, the ribonuclease inhibitor activity (GO:0008428) is attributed to the cytosolic large ribosomal subunit (GO:0022625), which is appropriate based on the findings in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the recent paper (PMID:38718836) provides evidence that the ribosome actually activates ANG by refolding its C-terminal tail rather than acting as a ribonuclease inhibitor. The model currently depicts the ribosome as having ribonuclease inhibitor activity, which seems to contradict this finding.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation:** Consider revising the model to reflect the latest research showing that the ribosome activates ANG rather than inhibiting it. This would involve changing the molecular function attribution and possibly the causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Complex Members:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model represents the cytosolic large ribosomal subunit (GO:0022625) but does not specify any members of this complex. While not strictly required, it would be helpful to include at least some key ribosomal proteins if they are directly involved in the interaction with ANG.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation:** Consider adding specific ribosomal proteins that interact with ANG if this information is available from the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Evidence and References:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) and references recent relevant literature (PMID:38718836, PMID:29100074, PMID:23843625, PMID:12533544). The evidence appears to be well-connected to the assertions in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:6690711d00002607 is generally well-constructed and accurately represents the current understanding of how ANG inhibits translation in response to stress through its tRNA ribonuclease activity. The model follows most GO-CAM best practices regarding representation of molecular functions, biological processes, cellular components, and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main issue is the potential misrepresentation of the ribosome's role in ANG activation based on the most recent research. Updating this aspect would make the model more accurate according to current knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is parsimonious and includes the key components and relationships necessary to understand the pathway, making it accessible to human interpretation.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model titled \"RNH1 inhibits the tRNA ribonuclease activity of ANG in the cytoplasm in absence of stress (Human)\" describes the interaction between angiogenin (ANG) and ribonuclease inhibitor 1 (RNH1) in human cells under normal (non-stress) conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary of the Model Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model focuses on how RNH1 inhibits the tRNA ribonuclease activity of ANG in the cytoplasm under non-stress conditions, while ANG's receptor ligand activity in the extracellular space contributes to signaling through plexin-B2 (PLXNB2).\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains the following key activities and relationships:\n",
      "1. ANG (UniProtKB:P03950) has receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018) in the extracellular space\n",
      "2. ANG has tRNA ribonuclease activity (GO:0004549) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "3. RNH1 (UniProtKB:P13489) has ribonuclease inhibitor activity (GO:0008428) in the cytoplasm\n",
      "4. PLXNB2 (UniProtKB:O15031) has signaling receptor activity (GO:0038023) on the plasma membrane\n",
      "5. Large ribosomal subunit (GO:0022625) has structural constituent of ribosome activity (GO:0003735) in the cytosol\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships show that:\n",
      "- ANG's receptor ligand activity directly positively regulates PLXNB2's signaling receptor activity\n",
      "- PLXNB2's signaling receptor activity positively regulates RNH1's ribonuclease inhibitor activity\n",
      "- RNH1's ribonuclease inhibitor activity directly negatively regulates ANG's tRNA ribonuclease activity\n",
      "- ANG's tRNA ribonuclease activity directly negatively regulates the ribosomal structural constituent activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Context Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model captures several key aspects of ANG and RNH1 biology that align with current scientific understanding:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ANG as a secreted protein with dual functions**:\n",
      "   - As a receptor ligand in the extracellular space\n",
      "   - As a tRNA ribonuclease in the cytoplasm\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **RNH1 as an inhibitor of ANG's ribonuclease activity**:\n",
      "   - This accurately represents RNH1's role in regulating ANG's enzymatic activity\n",
      "   - The paper by Pizzo et al. (PMID:23843625) confirms that RNH1 controls ANG's ribonucleolytic activity in different subcellular locations\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **PLXNB2 as the receptor for ANG**:\n",
      "   - This is supported by Yu et al. (PMID:29100074) which identified PLXNB2 as the functional receptor for ANG\n",
      "   - The model correctly shows PLXNB2 on the plasma membrane\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **ANG's effect on ribosomes**:\n",
      "   - Shows ANG's role in regulating translation through its ribonuclease activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. The model correctly uses appropriate GO terms for the activities of each protein\n",
      "2. The subcellular locations are accurately assigned\n",
      "3. The causal relationships make biological sense\n",
      "4. The evidence codes and references are properly attributed\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing complex representation**:\n",
      "   According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, when a complex is involved in specific activities, the representation depends on whether the specific subunit carrying the activity is known. The model could be improved by representing the ANG-RNH1 complex more explicitly, especially since their interaction is key to the biological regulation described.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing stress condition representation**:\n",
      "   The title explicitly mentions \"in absence of stress,\" but the model doesn't include a parallel stress condition pathway showing how the relationship between ANG and RNH1 changes under stress. This would provide a more complete biological picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incomplete mechanistic details**:\n",
      "   The model shows PLXNB2 positively regulating RNH1, but the mechanistic details of how PLXNB2 signaling affects RNH1 activity are not clear from the evidence provided. The literature (Pizzo et al.) indicates that under stress, RNH1 relocates to the nucleus, allowing ANG ribonuclease activity in the cytoplasm, but this spatial regulation isn't captured in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **PLXNB2 processing not represented**:\n",
      "   The paper by Artigiani et al. (PMID:12533544) shows that PLXNB2 undergoes proteolytic processing by proprotein convertases to function optimally as a receptor. This processing step is not represented in the model, which could be important for understanding the regulation of the receptor's activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ribosome activation mechanism**:\n",
      "   The recent paper by Loveland et al. (PMID:38718836) reveals that the ribosome is actually the activator of ANG's ribonuclease activity. This represents a significant advancement in understanding ANG's mechanism that is not captured in the current model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is generally well-supported by the cited literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PMID:29100074 (Yu et al., 2017) provides strong evidence for PLXNB2 as the functional receptor for ANG\n",
      "2. PMID:23843625 (Pizzo et al., 2013) supports the role of RNH1 in regulating ANG's subcellular localization and activity\n",
      "3. PMID:38718836 (Loveland et al., 2024) provides newer evidence about ribosome-mediated activation of ANG\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some causal relationships in the model may need additional evidence to fully support the specific directional effects indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add ANG-RNH1 complex**: Represent the interaction between ANG and RNH1 as a complex when relevant, especially since their physical interaction is critical for the inhibition of ANG's ribonuclease activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include stress condition pathway**: Add a parallel pathway showing how the relationships change under stress conditions, where RNH1 relocates to the nucleus, allowing ANG to perform its ribonuclease activity in the cytoplasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add PLXNB2 processing**: Include the proteolytic processing of PLXNB2 by proprotein convertases, which affects its function as a receptor for ANG.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Incorporate ribosome activation mechanism**: Update the model to reflect that the ribosome directly activates ANG's ribonuclease activity, based on the recent findings from Loveland et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Clarify directionality**: Provide more mechanistic details about how PLXNB2 signaling positively regulates RNH1 activity, as this relationship is not clearly explained in the cited literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "GO-CAM model gomodel:6690711d00002652 provides a good representation of the relationship between ANG and RNH1 under non-stress conditions. The model accurately captures the dual functionality of ANG as both a receptor ligand and a ribonuclease, as well as RNH1's role in inhibiting ANG's ribonuclease activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could be enhanced by incorporating more detailed mechanistic information, particularly regarding PLXNB2 processing, the formation of the ANG-RNH1 complex, and the recently discovered role of ribosomes in activating ANG. Additionally, adding a parallel pathway showing the changes under stress conditions would provide a more complete biological picture.\n",

      "1. The gene trp1 in *S. pombe* encodes activities for both phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase and indole-3-glycerol-phosphate lyase, which is correctly represented in the model where both activities are enabled by PomBase:SPBC1539.09c.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The overall pathway structure (chorismate → anthranilate → phosphoribosylanthranilate → indole-3-glycerol-phosphate → tryptophan) follows the established understanding of tryptophan biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The evidence in the model cites relevant PMIDs and database references to support the annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Control Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Model Comment Issue**: The model contains the comment \"I used chatGPT for this one\" which should be removed or replaced with a more professional description of the model creation process. AI tools can be used for assistance but should not be cited as the primary source for model creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence Documentation**: Some of the evidence citations are through database cross-references rather than direct experimental evidence. While this is acceptable for well-established pathways, it would be beneficial to include more primary literature references where possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Input/Output Specification**: Not all activities have explicitly defined inputs and outputs. For a complete biochemical pathway model, each reaction should specify both inputs and outputs to ensure the pathway is fully connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enzyme Complex Representation**: The model doesn't clearly indicate whether any of these enzymes function as part of complexes. For example, anthranilate synthase in many organisms is a complex of two proteins. According to the literature (PMID:24186364), in *S. pombe*, the anthranilate synthase is encoded by two genes (trp1C and trp3), but this complex formation is not represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Remove the \"I used chatGPT for this one\" comment and replace with a professional description of the biological process being modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add specific inputs and outputs for all enzymatic reactions in the pathway to ensure complete biochemical connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Clarify whether anthranilate synthase functions as a complex in *S. pombe* and if so, represent it according to the complex annotation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider adding more primary literature evidence to strengthen the model's scientific basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Double-check the gene product identifiers with current PomBase annotations to ensure they are up-to-date.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the model correctly captures the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway in *S. pombe* with appropriate molecular functions and causal connections. The unique feature of trp1 encoding two enzymatic activities is properly captured. With the minor improvements suggested above, this would be a high-quality GO-CAM representation of this important metabolic pathway.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:6690711d00002904](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6690711d00002904)) represents the \"L-histidine biosynthetic process\" (GO:0000105) in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* (fission yeast). The model captures the enzymatic steps of the histidine biosynthesis pathway with multiple gene products performing specific molecular functions that are causally connected to create a coherent representation of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes 8 activities representing the enzymatic steps of histidine biosynthesis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ATP phosphoribosyltransferase (his1)** - PomBase:SPAC25G10.05c (GO:0003879)\n",
      "2. **Phosphoribosyl-ATP diphosphatase (his7)** - PomBase:SPBC29A3.02c (GO:0004636)\n",

      "9. **Histidinol dehydrogenase (his2)** - PomBase:SPBC1711.13 (GO:0004399)\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these activities are annotated to occur in the cytosol (GO:0005829) and are part of the L-histidine biosynthetic process (GO:0000105).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Flow and Causal Connections\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively uses the causal relationship predicate \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) to connect the activities in the correct sequential order, representing the flow of metabolites through the pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. his1 (ATP phosphoribosyltransferase) → his7 (Phosphoribosyl-ATP diphosphatase)\n",
      "2. his7 (Phosphoribosyl-ATP diphosphatase) → his7 (Phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase)\n",
      "3. his7 (Phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase) → his6 (1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5-[(5-phosphoribosylamino)methylideneamino]imidazole-4-carboxamide isomerase)\n",
      "4. his6 → his4 (Imidazoleglycerol-phosphate synthase)\n",
      "5. his4 → his5 (Imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase)\n",
      "6. his5 → his3 (Histidinol-phosphate transaminase)\n",
      "7. his3 → SPCC1672.01 (Histidinol-phosphatase)\n",
      "8. SPCC1672.01 → his2 (Histidinol dehydrogenase)\n",
      "\n",
      "The final product of the pathway is correctly annotated as L-histidine (CHEBI:15971).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well supported by evidence:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Multiple empirical evidence codes are used, including:\n",
      "   - ECO:0000316 (genetic interaction evidence)\n",
      "   - ECO:0000304 (author statement with traceable reference)\n",
      "   - ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence)\n",
      "   - ECO:0000266 (sequence orthology evidence)\n",
      "   - ECO:0000318 (biological aspect of ancestor evidence)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Key references include:\n",
      "   - PMID:8299169 - Specific reference for his7 function\n",

      "\n",
      "## Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Completeness**: The model captures all the major steps in the histidine biosynthesis pathway with appropriate enzyme functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct cellular location**: All activities are properly located in the cytosol (GO:0005829), which is consistent with current knowledge about histidine biosynthesis in yeast.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The causal flow is well represented using the \"provides input for\" relationship (RO:0002413), correctly showing the sequential steps in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence quality**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes and references, including experimental evidence where available.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Bifunctional enzyme representation**: The bifunctional nature of the his7 gene product is correctly represented with two distinct activities (phosphoribosyl-ATP diphosphatase and phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Input/output annotations**: The model correctly includes the substrate input (CHEBI:73183, 1-(5-phospho-beta-D-ribosyl)-ATP) and final product (CHEBI:15971, L-histidine).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Minor Issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redundant causal connection**: There appears to be a duplicated causal relationship from his4 (PomBase:SPBC418.01c) to his5 (PomBase:SPBC21H7.07c) - this redundancy should be removed to maintain model parsimony.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing evidence**: One causal association (from his3 to SPCC1672.01) lacks evidence annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Nomenclature consistency**: Gene naming is consistent (using his1-7), but SPCC1672.01 lacks a standard gene name, which slightly reduces model clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Remove the redundant causal relationship between his4 and his5.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add appropriate evidence for the causal association between his3 and SPCC1672.01.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Verify if SPCC1672.01 has an assigned gene name (possibly his8 or his9) for consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider adding additional regulatory information if available, such as feedback inhibition of his1 by histidine, which is a common regulatory feature in histidine biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model is a high-quality representation of the L-histidine biosynthetic process in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*. It accurately captures the enzymatic steps, molecular functions, cellular locations, and pathway structure in accordance with established biological knowledge. The model demonstrates proper use of GO-CAM conventions and is well-supported by evidence. With the minor improvements suggested above, this model would serve as an excellent reference for the histidine biosynthesis pathway in fission yeast.\n",

      "\n",
      "This model represents a pathway where PAQR3 positively regulates cholesterol biosynthesis by anchoring the SREBF1-SCAP complex to the Golgi apparatus. The model captures key activities involved in this process, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. SREBF1 (P36956) DNA-binding transcription factor activity in the nucleus\n",
      "2. KPNB1 (Q14974) nuclear import signal receptor activity in the cytoplasm\n",

      "\n",
      "## Detailed Component Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "### Activities and Causal Associations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **SREBF1 (P36956)**: Functions as a DNA-binding transcription factor in the nucleus, participating in positive regulation of cholesterol biosynthetic process. This is well-supported by the literature as SREBF1 is known to be a master regulator of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **KPNB1 (Q14974)**: Functions as a nuclear import signal receptor in the cytoplasm, participating in NLS-bearing protein import into nucleus. The model correctly establishes a causal relationship where KPNB1 positively regulates SREBF1's activity, representing the import of cleaved SREBF1 into the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **INSIG1 (O15503)**: Functions in protein sequestering activity in the ER membrane, participating in SREBP-SCAP complex retention in the ER. The model correctly shows INSIG1 negatively regulating MBTPS2, representing how INSIG1 prevents SREBP cleavage under high cholesterol conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **MBTPS2 (O43462)**: Functions as a metalloendopeptidase in the Golgi membrane, participating in protein maturation. The model correctly shows MBTPS2 positively regulating KPNB1, representing the proteolytic processing of SREBP that allows its nuclear fragment to be transported into the nucleus.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **PAQR3 (Q6TCH7)**: Functions as a protein-membrane adaptor in the Golgi membrane, participating in protein localization to Golgi apparatus. The model correctly shows PAQR3 positively regulating MBTPS2, representing how PAQR3 anchors the SREBP-SCAP complex to the Golgi where MBTPS2 can cleave it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by published research. In particular, PMID:26311497 (Xu et al., 2015) provides extensive evidence for the role of PAQR3 in anchoring the SCAP-SREBP complex to the Golgi and thereby enhancing SREBP processing. Other references including PMID:32497488, PMID:12177166, PMID:15899885, and PMID:11163209 support various aspects of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment of Accuracy and Completeness\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of how PAQR3 functions in cholesterol homeostasis according to the literature. It correctly captures:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The role of PAQR3 as a Golgi anchor protein for the SCAP-SREBP complex\n",
      "2. The antagonistic relationship between INSIG1 (ER retention) and PAQR3 (Golgi anchoring)\n",
      "3. The sequential proteolytic processing of SREBP by proteases like MBTPS2\n",
      "4. The nuclear import of processed SREBP to activate cholesterol biosynthesis genes\n",
      "\n",
      "### Minor Issues and Potential Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Duplicate Causal Association**: There appears to be a duplicate causal association from MBTPS2 to KPNB1. One of these associations has no evidence listed, which should be addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cholesterol Feedback Representation**: While the model represents the pathway well, it could potentially benefit from explicitly representing how cholesterol levels modulate the interactions between INSIG1, SCAP, and PAQR3, as described in PMID:26311497.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **SCAP Role**: While SCAP (Q12770) is mentioned in the title and is essential to this pathway, it does not appear as an enabled-by component in any activity. The model could be enhanced by explicitly including SCAP's activity as an escort protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM guidelines in terms of:\n",
      "- Using appropriate GO terms for molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes\n",
      "- Using appropriate causal relationship predicates\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This model represents IGF1-mediated signaling via the IGF1R receptor in humans. It includes four key activities:\n",
      "1. IGF1R receptor activity (enabled by P08069/IGF1R)\n",
      "2. IRS1 signaling adaptor activity (enabled by P35568/IRS1)\n",
      "3. IRS2 signaling adaptor activity (enabled by Q9Y4H2/IRS2)\n",
      "4. IGF1 growth factor activity (enabled by P05019/IGF1)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "- The model correctly depicts the signaling cascade from IGF1 to IGF1R to downstream adaptors (IRS1 and IRS2)\n",
      "- All activities are grounded in appropriate evidence and references (PMIDs)\n",
      "- The model uses appropriate causal relationships (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\")\n",
      "- Activities are correctly linked to appropriate cellular locations\n",
      "- The model incorporates the correct biological process (GO:0048009 \"insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway\")\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Molecular Function Annotations\n",
      "The signaling adaptor activities for IRS1 and IRS2 are both annotated with GO:0035591 \"signaling adaptor activity\", which is correct. However, according to the \"How to annotate molecular adaptors\" document, adaptors should have \"has input\" relationships to the molecules they bring together. In this model:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Both IRS1 and IRS2 should have \"has input\" relationships to their binding partners\n",
      "- According to the literature you provided, IRS1 and IRS2 bind to both IGF1R and downstream effectors like PI3K\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Downstream Signaling Pathway Representation\n",
      "The model stops at IRS1/IRS2 and doesn't represent further downstream signaling, such as:\n",
      "- PI3K pathway activation (mentioned in the literature)\n",
      "- MAPK pathway activation \n",
      "- AKT signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "These pathways are well-established in IGF1 signaling based on the provided literature, particularly evident in PMID:16878150 and PMID:17827393.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. IGF1 and IGF1R Relationship\n",
      "According to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines\", the relationship between IGF1 (ligand) and IGF1R (receptor) should be modeled as:\n",
      "- IGF1 \"directly positively regulates\" IGF1R (which is currently represented correctly)\n",
      "- IGF1 should have a GO:0048018 or child term (receptor ligand activity)\n",
      "  - The model correctly uses GO:0008083 \"growth factor activity\" which is appropriate for IGF1\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Additional Context\n",
      "The model could benefit from adding:\n",
      "- Phosphorylation events (tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1/IRS2)\n",
      "- Representation of PI3K (PIK3R1) which is a key binding partner of IRS1/IRS2\n",
      "- The subcellular location for IRS1 and IRS2 is cytoplasm (GO:0005737), which is correct but could be more specific based on the literature\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence codes used in the model are appropriate:\n",
      "- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- ECO:0000305 (curator inference used in manual assertion)\n",
      "- ECO:0000250 (sequence similarity evidence used in manual assertion with UniProtKB:P35569)\n",
      "- ECO:0000353 (physical interaction evidence used in manual assertion)\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall causal flow is biologically accurate, representing:\n",
      "1. IGF1 → IGF1R\n",
      "2. IGF1R → IRS1 and IRS2\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a good foundation for representing IGF1 signaling through IGF1R, IRS1, and IRS2. It captures the core interactions accurately but could be expanded to include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Explicit \"has input\" relationships for IRS1 and IRS2 adaptors\n",
      "2. Downstream signaling events (PI3K/AKT, MAPK pathways)\n",
      "3. Phosphorylation events that are key to this signaling cascade\n",
      "4. Additional binding partners like PIK3R1 (p85 subunit of PI3K)\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with current biological knowledge about IGF1 signaling and follows most GO-CAM best practices. With the suggested improvements, it would provide a more comprehensive representation of this important signaling pathway.\n",

      "   - This is appropriate since both protein components have well-defined activities in the complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **G Protein Signaling**:\n",
      "   - The G protein (GNAS) is correctly annotated with G protein activity and shown as being regulated by the receptor (CALCRL).\n",

      "While the model is generally well-constructed, there are a few minor aspects that could be improved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Completeness**: The model could potentially include downstream effects of cAMP production, such as PKA activation, to more fully represent the signaling pathway's outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Location of ADCY6**: While not explicitly annotated in the model, ADCY6 is typically localized to the plasma membrane. Adding this cellular location annotation would be more precise.\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:66a3e0bb00001159) is a high-quality representation of adrenomedullin signaling through the CALCRL-RAMP2 receptor complex.

      "\n",
      "## Pathway Representation and Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the CGRP signaling pathway with the following sequential steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Hormone Activity (CALCA/CGRP1, UniProtKB:P06881-1)** - The CALCA protein acts as a hormone (GO:0005179) in the extracellular space (GO:0005615), which directly positively regulates the CALCRL receptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Coreceptor Activity (RAMP1, UniProtKB:O60894)** - RAMP1 functions as a coreceptor (GO:0015026) on the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), which directly positively regulates the CALCRL receptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **CGRP Receptor Activity (CALCRL, UniProtKB:Q16602)** - The calcitonin receptor-like receptor displays calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor activity (GO:0001635) on the plasma membrane (GO:0005886) and directly positively regulates G protein activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **G Protein Activity (GNAS, UniProtKB:Q5JWF2)** - The G protein alpha subunit shows G protein activity (GO:0003925) in the cytosol (GO:0005829) and directly positively regulates adenylate cyclase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Adenylate Cyclase Activity (ADCY6, UniProtKB:O43306)** - Adenylate cyclase converts ATP to cyclic AMP (GO:0004016), with cAMP (CHEBI:17489) as the output.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Assessment of Model Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological Accuracy**: The model accurately reflects the current scientific understanding of CGRP signaling as evidenced by the literature citations (PMID:33602864, PMID:9620797, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Use of GO Terms**: The molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes are correctly assigned to each protein.\n",

      "3. **Proper Causal Relationships**: The model uses \"RO:0002629\" (directly positively regulates) appropriately for each step in the signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Receptor Complex Representation**: The model correctly represents the CALCRL-RAMP1 complex, where RAMP1 serves as a coreceptor that is essential for CALCRL function, consistent with the literature (PMID:9620797).\n",

      "5. **Cellular Localization**: Each protein activity is appropriately located in the cellular compartment where it occurs (extracellular, membrane, cytosol).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Proper Evidence Coding**: Each association is backed by appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Potential Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: The model represents RAMP1 and CALCRL as separate entities that regulate each other, rather than as a functional complex. According to the GO-CAM guidelines for complex annotation (\"How_to_annotate_complexes_in_GO-CAM\"), when two proteins form a functional complex where both activities are important, they can be represented as a heterodimeric receptor. However, the current representation is also valid and matches the biological reality where RAMP1 acts to transport CALCRL to the membrane and modify its ligand specificity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Temporal Aspects**: The model doesn't explicitly capture the temporal aspect where RAMP1 first transports CALCRL to the plasma membrane before ligand binding occurs. However, this limitation is inherent to the GO-CAM modeling framework and not specific to this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is a high-quality representation of CGRP signaling mediated by the CALCRL-RAMP1 receptor complex. It accurately depicts the activation of G protein signaling through adenylate cyclase, leading to cAMP production. The model is well-supported by literature evidence and follows GO-CAM best practices for representing biological pathways.\n",

      "1. **Functional Output**: While the model shows cAMP (CHEBI:17489) as the output of ADCY6 activity, it might be beneficial to extend the model to include downstream effects of cAMP, such as activation of PKA, which would provide a more complete picture of the physiological impact of this signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Alternative Ligands**: Although the model specifically focuses on CALCB/CGRP2 signaling, it could be noted that CALCA/CGRP1 can also activate this same receptor complex with similar effects, as mentioned in the literature (PMID:9620797).\n",

      "   - Most relations use ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence), which is a strong evidence type\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accurately represents the amylin receptor complex (CALCR-RAMP1) based on recent literature\n",
      "2. Includes appropriate cellular locations for all components\n",
      "3. Uses strong evidence codes with recent, relevant publications\n",
      "4. Correctly models the complete signaling cascade from ligand to second messenger production\n",
      "5. Correctly uses biological process terms to provide context for each activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Opportunities for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally very well-constructed, here are some minor suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cellular component for ADCY6**: The model does not explicitly specify a cellular component for ADCY6. According to literature, adenylate cyclase 6 is typically membrane-bound, so adding 'plasma membrane' as the cellular location would make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional downstream effects**: The model could potentially be expanded to include downstream effects of cAMP production, such as activation of protein kinase A (PKA).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Signaling by Amylin mediated by IAPP ligand activating CALCR-RAMP1 (AMYR1) receptor complex (Human)\" (gomodel:66a3e0bb00001796) is of high quality and correctly represents the current understanding of amylin receptor signaling. The model adheres to GO-CAM annotation guidelines for signaling receptors and provides a clear representation of the signaling pathway with appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The representation of the CALCR-RAMP1 receptor complex and its activation by IAPP is particularly well-documented with recent literature. The model is of production quality and provides valuable information about the amylin receptor 1 signaling pathway in humans.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Biological Processes\n",
      "- All activities are appropriately assigned to relevant biological processes\n",
      "- The model correctly represents the negative regulation of TCR signaling pathway by ITPRIPL1\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cellular Components\n",
      "- All activities have appropriate cellular component annotations\n",
      "- The distinction between membrane-located and cytoplasmic activities is clear\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "- The causal relationships correctly use appropriate relation terms:\n",

      "  - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for activating actions\n",

      "- The ZAP70-LAT relationship uses an older citation (PMID:9489702), which is appropriate as this is an established interaction in TCR signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately reflects the findings from the recent publication (PMID:38614099), which describes ITPRIPL1 as a novel ligand for CD3E that inhibits T cell activation. The key mechanisms represented are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ITPRIPL1 binding to CD3E on the cell surface\n",
      "2. This binding induces NCK1 recruitment to CD3E\n",
      "3. NCK1 prevents CD3E from interacting with ZAP70\n",
      "4. This disrupts the normal TCR signaling cascade (CD3E → LCK → ZAP70 → LAT → downstream signaling)\n",

      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I have a few minor suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional Cellular Components**: Consider adding more specific cellular components for activities where appropriate (e.g., immunological synapse for some of the signaling events)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **TCR Complex Representation**: The model shows the T cell receptor complex (GO:0042101) with \"members:[]\". It might be beneficial to explicitly include the TCR complex members to provide a more complete representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream Signaling**: The current model ends at LAT adaptor activity. To provide a more complete picture of the pathway, it could be extended to include some key downstream mediators of TCR signaling (e.g., PLCγ1, MAPK cascade components).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a high-quality GO-CAM model that effectively captures a recently discovered immunoregulatory mechanism. It is scientifically accurate, follows GO-CAM best practices, and presents a clear representation of how ITPRIPL1 negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling. The causal relationships between activities are appropriately represented, making the flow of biological information clear and interpretable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model serves as an excellent representation of how ITPRIPL1 functions as an inhibitory ligand of CD3E, providing important context for understanding immune evasion mechanisms that may be relevant to cancer immunotherapy, as described in the source publication.\n",

      "### Summary of scientific content:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the literature reviewed, this model represents how TMEFF1 acts as a restriction factor for HSV-1 infection in neurons. According to the recent papers (PMID:39048823 and PMID:39048830), TMEFF1 is a neuron-specific protein that blocks HSV-1 entry by interfering with the interaction between the viral glycoprotein D (gD) and its host cell receptor NECTIN1. \n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows that HSV-1 glycoprotein D acts as a ligand that binds to NECTIN1, which functions as a virus receptor. This interaction facilitates viral entry into host cells. TMEFF1 interferes with this process by binding to NECTIN1, preventing its association with viral gD and thereby inhibiting viral entry.\n",

      "## Assessment of the GO-CAM Model:\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me thoroughly review this model against GO-CAM best practices and scientific accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Model structure and logical flow**: \n",
      "   The model correctly represents the biological process of HSV-1 entry into cells and how TMEFF1 inhibits this process. The causal relationships between activities are appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular function annotation**:\n",
      "   - The molecular function annotations are appropriate: gD as a receptor ligand, NECTIN1 as a virus receptor, and TMEFF1 as a receptor ligand inhibitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological process annotation**:\n",
      "   - The biological process annotations are appropriate: gD and NECTIN1 are part of \"symbiont entry into host cell\" while TMEFF1 is part of \"negative regulation of viral entry into host cell\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular component annotation**:\n",
      "   - gD is correctly placed in the \"virion membrane\"\n",
      "   - Both NECTIN1 and TMEFF1 are appropriately assigned to the \"plasma membrane\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Causal relationships**:\n",
      "   - The relationships between activities are correctly represented:\n",
      "     - gD directly positively regulates NECTIN1's virus receptor activity\n",
      "     - TMEFF1 directly negatively regulates gD's ligand activity (by preventing gD-NECTIN1 interaction)\n",
      "     - TMEFF1 directly positively regulates gD's ligand activity (although this relationship needs closer examination)\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Evidence**:\n",
      "   - The model uses appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence)\n",
      "   - The evidence is based on recent publications that directly demonstrate these interactions\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Scientific accuracy**:\n",
      "   The model accurately represents the biological mechanism described in the literature. The papers clearly show that TMEFF1 restricts HSV-1 infection by interfering with the interaction between gD and NECTIN1.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Concerns and Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal relationship between TMEFF1 and gD**:\n",
      "   - There's a potential contradiction in having TMEFF1 both positively and negatively regulate gD's ligand activity. Based on the literature, TMEFF1 should only negatively regulate the gD-NECTIN1 interaction, not positively regulate it. This should be reviewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cellular location for gD**:\n",
      "   - gD is correctly located in the virion membrane, but for this model to show the interaction more clearly, it might be useful to also note that the interaction occurs at the host cell surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mechanism clarification**:\n",
      "   - From the literature, TMEFF1 doesn't directly interact with gD but rather with NECTIN1, preventing gD from binding to NECTIN1. This mechanism could be more clearly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential missing relationships**:\n",
      "   - The model could potentially benefit from showing a direct causal relationship between TMEFF1 and NECTIN1, since TMEFF1 physically interacts with NECTIN1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this review, the GO-CAM model gomodel:66a3e0bb00002740 largely adheres to best practices and accurately represents the biological process. The only significant concern is the potentially contradictory causal relationship where TMEFF1 both positively and negatively regulates gD activity, which should be reviewed.\n",

The model shows that TMEFF1 blocks the association between the human non-muscle myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9/NMMHC-IIA) and the viral envelope glycoprotein B (gB), thereby preventing HSV-1 entry into cells.\n",

      "## Scientific Evidence and Literature Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is based on two very recent papers from 2024 (PMID:39048823 and PMID:39048830), which identify TMEFF1 as a neuron-specific restriction factor for HSV-1. These papers demonstrate that:\n",

      "\n",
      "## Review Comments\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Timely and relevant representation**: The model captures very recent scientific findings published in 2024 about a novel restriction factor for HSV-1 infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clear causal relationships**: The model properly uses causal relations (RO:0002629 and RO:0002630) to show how TMEFF1 regulates the interaction between viral gB and cellular MYH9.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper biological context**: The model correctly places TMEFF1's activity in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886) and as part of the negative regulation of viral entry into host cell (GO:0046597) process, while also placing MYH9's activity on the cell surface (GO:0009986) and gB's activity in the virion membrane (GO:0055036).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dual regulation paradox**: The model shows TMEFF1 both positively and negatively regulating gB's activity. Based on the literature, TMEFF1 should only negatively regulate this interaction, so the positive regulation causal relationship (`RO:0002629`) from TMEFF1's activity to gB's activity appears incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Duplicate causal associations**: There are two identical causal associations from gB's activity to MYH9's activity (both using `RO:0002629`), which is redundant and potentially confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing molecular interactions**: The literature indicates that TMEFF1 interacts with NECTIN-1 (another HSV-1 receptor), but this interaction is not represented in the model. While this may be beyond the current scope, it would provide a more complete picture of TMEFF1's restriction mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular context specificity**: The model could benefit from more specific cellular context annotations indicating that this mechanism is specific to neurons, perhaps by including a cell type annotation (e.g., CL:0000540 for neuron).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove duplicate causal association**: One of the two identical causal associations from gB to MYH9 should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct causal relationships**: Revise the causal relationship from TMEFF1 to gB to only use the negative regulation predicate (`RO:0002630`), removing the positive regulation (`RO:0002629`).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add cell type context**: Consider adding CL:0000540 (neuron) as an additional context annotation to provide information about the cell-type specificity of this mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider expanding the model**: If appropriate, consider expanding the model to include other known interactions, such as TMEFF1's interaction with NECTIN-1, to provide a more comprehensive representation of the mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Clarify molecular mechanism**: The model could potentially benefit from annotations that better explain the molecular mechanism by which TMEFF1 inhibits the gB-MYH9 interaction (e.g., by adding information about TMEFF1's domains involved in this inhibition).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model effectively represents a novel and important mechanism for the restriction of HSV-1 infection in neurons, based on very recent scientific literature. With a few minor corrections and potential enhancements, it will provide an accurate and valuable representation of this biological process. The model highlights the role of TMEFF1 as a neuron-specific HSV-1 restriction factor, which has significant implications for understanding the brain's intrinsic immunity against viral infections.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:66a3e0bb00002793](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:66a3e0bb00002793)) represents a molecular interaction pathway describing how TMEFF1 restricts herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in the brain by blocking the association between MYH10 (non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB) and the viral envelope glycoprotein B. The model consists of three main activities with causal associations between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological coherence**: The model accurately represents recently published scientific literature (PMID:39048823 and PMID:39048830) showing TMEFF1's role as a neuron-specific restriction factor for HSV-1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate connectivity**: The causal flow from TMEFF1's receptor ligand inhibitor activity to glycoprotein B's receptor ligand activity and finally to MYH10's virus receptor activity follows a logical pathway consistent with the mechanism described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper cellular compartmentalization**: Each activity is correctly annotated with its cellular location: TMEFF1 at the plasma membrane, glycoprotein B at the virion membrane, and MYH10 at the cell surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate biological context**: All activities are properly contextualized within the biological process of \"symbiont entry into host cell\" (GO:0046718), and for TMEFF1, additionally with \"negative regulation of viral entry into host cell\" (GO:0046597).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Well-evidenced associations**: Each activity and causal relationship is supported by appropriate evidence codes and references to primary literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Possible redundancy in causal associations**: There are two identical causal associations from gB to MYH10 with the same predicate (RO:0002629) and the same evidence. This appears redundant and could be consolidated into a single association.\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "\"causal_associations\":[\n",
      "  {\"type\":\"CausalAssociation\",\"evidence\":[{\"term\":\"ECO:0000314\",\"reference\":\"PMID:20944748\",\"provenances\":[{\"contributor\":\"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7299-6685\",\"date\":\"2024-08-08\"}]}],\"predicate\":\"RO:0002629\",\"downstream_activity\":\"gomodel:66a3e0bb00002793/66a3e0bb00002794\"},\n",

      "]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence code detail**: While the model uses appropriate evidence codes, for some associations such as TMEFF1's occurrence in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), the reference cited is PMID:39048830, but it might be beneficial to add more specific evidence beyond just the paper reference (e.g., specific figure or section of the paper that demonstrates this localization).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex annotation**: The model appropriately represents activities of individual proteins rather than complexes, which is consistent with GO-CAM guidelines for cases where the specific subunits carrying the activities are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationship predicates:\n",
      "   - RO:0002630 \"directly negatively regulates\" from TMEFF1 to gB\n",
      "   - RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\" from gB to MYH10\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence codes**: The model uses ECO:0000314 \"direct assay evidence used in manual assertion\" for molecular functions and causal associations, which is appropriate for these experimental findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Location annotation**: Each activity is appropriately annotated with its cellular location.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove redundant causal association**: The duplicate causal association from gB to MYH10 should be removed to maintain model parsimony.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider adding sequence similarity evidence details**: For gB's occurrence in \"virion membrane\" (GO:0055036), the evidence is listed as ECO:0000250 \"sequence similarity evidence used in manual assertion\" with reference to UniProt:P10211, but it might be helpful to provide additional context for this inference.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider enhancing the model with additional interactions**: Based on the literature (PMID:39048823), TMEFF1 also interacts with NECTIN-1, which is another HSV-1 receptor. This additional interaction could be incorporated into the model to provide a more complete representation of TMEFF1's mechanism of action in restricting HSV-1 entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this GO-CAM model is well-constructed and faithfully represents the biological pathway of TMEFF1-mediated restriction of HSV-1 entry into neurons via inhibition of the interaction between viral glycoprotein B and MYH10. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities and causal relationships. The minor issues identified, particularly the redundant causal association, could be addressed to further improve the model's quality and clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively captures the recent findings on TMEFF1's role as a neuron-specific restriction factor for HSV-1, making it a valuable resource for understanding viral entry mechanisms and host defense in the central nervous system.\n",

      "## Summary\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling pathway in humans through the TPO receptor (MPL), illustrating a canonical cytokine signaling cascade through JAK2 and STAT5A. The model captures a linear causal sequence from TPO binding to its receptor, subsequent activation of JAK2 kinase, and ultimately STAT5A-mediated transcriptional regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Content\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of 4 key molecular activities, all part of the thrombopoietin-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0038163):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **TPO (UniProtKB:P40225)** - cytokine activity (GO:0005125)\n",
      "   - Occurs in: extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "   - Causal relation: directly positively regulates MPL activity\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MPL/TPO Receptor (UniProtKB:P40238)** - thrombopoietin receptor activity (GO:0038164)\n",
      "   - Occurs in: plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - Causal relation: directly positively regulates JAK2 activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **JAK2 (UniProtKB:O60674)** - protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713)\n",
      "   - Occurs in: cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - Causal relation: directly positively regulates STAT5A activity\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **STAT5A (UniProtKB:P42229)** - DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700)\n",
      "   - Occurs in: nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Control Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. **Correct biological pathway**: The model accurately represents the canonical TPO signaling pathway with appropriate causal connections between TPO, its receptor MPL, JAK2, and STAT5A.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper localization**: All components have appropriate cellular locations (TPO in extracellular space, MPL at the plasma membrane, JAK2 in cytoplasm, and STAT5A in the nucleus).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The model uses \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) relations correctly to show the direct activation sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidential support**: Each activity has appropriate evidence codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inclusion of receptor dimerization**: The current model does not explicitly capture the dimerization of MPL receptors, which is a critical mechanistic step in receptor activation. The latest research (PMID:37633268) shows that TPO bridges two MPL chains via high and low-affinity interfaces, which is important for signal transduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **JAK2 autophosphorylation**: The model doesn't explicitly represent JAK2 autophosphorylation, which is a key step in JAK2 activation following receptor dimerization.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **STAT5 dimerization**: STAT5 factors form dimers after phosphorylation by JAK2, before translocation to the nucleus. This step is not explicitly represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing complementary signaling pathways**: TPO-MPL signaling activates multiple downstream pathways in addition to JAK-STAT, including MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways (as evidenced in PMID:25538044), which contribute to the biological responses but aren't represented in this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complex representation**: According to GO-CAM best practices for representing complexes, the model could potentially benefit from indicating whether activities are carried out by specific subunits or by the complex as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Literature and Evidence Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the cited literature:\n",
      "- PMID:25538044 confirms TPO interaction with MPL and downstream signaling\n",
      "- PMID:8007942 validates JAK2's tyrosine kinase activity in this pathway\n",
      "- PMID:10502458 confirms JAK2's cytoplasmic localization\n",
      "- PMID:9122198 supports involvement in the TPO signaling pathway\n",
      "- PMID:9516478 confirms STAT5A nuclear localization\n",
      "- PMID:10919676 validates STAT5A's role in cytokine signaling\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent literature (PMID:37633268) provides additional structural insights into TPO-MPL complex formation that could enhance the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add receptor dimerization**: Consider representing the TPO-induced dimerization of MPL receptors based on recent structural insights (PMID:37633268).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include additional signaling branches**: Add parallel signaling cascades activated by TPO-MPL, particularly the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, which play important roles in TPO-mediated megakaryopoiesis and stem cell maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Represent protein modifications**: Include phosphorylation events of JAK2 and STAT5A as these are critical for signal transduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add STAT5 dimerization**: Include the dimerization of STAT5 after phosphorylation by JAK2.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider biological outcomes**: Add connections to biological processes that result from this signaling pathway, such as megakaryocyte differentiation or platelet production.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:66a3e0bb00002890 provides a good representation of the core TPO signaling pathway. It captures the essential components and causal relationships accurately with appropriate evidence. The model could be enhanced by incorporating more detailed mechanistic steps like receptor dimerization, protein modifications, and additional signaling branches to provide a more comprehensive representation of TPO signaling and its biological outcomes.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Assessment According to GO-CAM Best Practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Activity Representation**: The model correctly represents molecular activities linked to specific gene products, with appropriate GO molecular function terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Representation**: The model appears to follow best practices by assigning molecular activities to specific gene products rather than complexes. However, one annotation (CHEBI:36080 \"protein\") should be replaced with a specific gene product or complex ID if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Relationships**: The model correctly uses the RO:0002413 (*provides input for*) relationship for metabolic pathways, showing the flow of activities and metabolites.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Context**: The model properly includes cellular context for activities (GO:0005737, GO:0005739, GO:0005829).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Part_of Relationships**: Each activity is properly associated with a biological process using part_of relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Evidence Codes**: The model generally uses appropriate evidence codes, though there's room for improvement with more direct experimental evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Address Missing Evidence**: Add evidence to the activity for 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (GO:0003874).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Specific Gene Product Assignment**: Replace the generic \"protein\" (CHEBI:36080) annotation with a specific gene product if known.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Literature Support**: Where possible, add more direct experimental evidence (PMIDs) to strengthen the model beyond orthology and sequence similarity evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pathway Verification**: Verify that the tetrahydrobiopterin pathway branch is accurately represented with all necessary intermediates and enzymes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Documentation**: Consider adding a brief description or notes about the model to help users understand the biological significance of this pathway in S. pombe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-structured GO-CAM model that effectively represents the pteridine-containing compound metabolic processes in fission yeast. With the minor improvements suggested above, it would be even more valuable to the scientific community.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the GDP-L-fucose salvage pathway in mouse, showing how free fucose is taken up, phosphorylated, and converted to GDP-L-fucose for use in glycosylation. The model captures the key enzymes and transport steps in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the GDP-L-fucose salvage pathway as described in the literature, particularly in reference [PMID:14686921](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14686921/), which describes the cloning and expression of murine L-fucokinase and GDP-L-fucose pyrophosphorylase.

      "4. **GDP-L-fucose transport**: SLC35C1 transports GDP-L-fucose to the Golgi apparatus\n",
      "\n",

      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper causal connections**: The model uses RO:0002413 (\"provides input for\") appropriately to connect the activities in the pathway.\n",
      "2. **Proper cellular component annotation**: Each activity is annotated with the correct cellular component (cytosol, Golgi membrane, plasma membrane).\n",
      "3. **Evidence codes**: Appropriate evidence codes are used, including ECO:0000314 (direct assay) and ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype).\n",
      "4. **Input/output annotations**: The chemical inputs and outputs are properly annotated for each reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is generally well-constructed, I identified a few areas for improvement:\n",

      "1. **Missing evidence for some inputs/outputs**: Some of the molecular associations (for input/output molecules) lack evidence annotations. For example, in the FCSK activity (gomodel:66b5638000000056/66b5638000000080), inputs CHEBI:42589 and CHEBI:30616 have no evidence annotations.\n",

      "2. **Missing cellular component annotation**: The FPGT activity (gomodel:66b5638000000056/66b5638000000078) has a cellular component (GO:0005829 - cytosol) but lacks evidence annotation for this assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Suggestion for improved pathway flow**: The model could be enhanced by explicitly connecting the initial transport activity (SLC2A1) to subsequent enzymes. Currently, SLC2A1 (GLUT1) is shown positively regulating FCSK, which is correct, but a clearer representation of how extracellular fucose enters the metabolic pathway might be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complete the cycle**: The model could potentially be expanded to show what happens to GDP-L-fucose after it's transported into the Golgi - i.e., its incorporation into glycoproteins and glycolipids.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Literature Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The biological content of the model is well-supported by multiple publications:\n",
      "\n",
      "- PMID:14686921 establishes the key enzymes of the salvage pathway\n",
      "- PMID:36423686 documents SLC2A1 (GLUT1) as an L-fucose transporter\n",

      "- PMID:17276979 supports the SLC35C1 GDP-fucose transporter function\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the GDP-L-fucose salvage pathway in mouse. It captures the key molecular activities, their correct sequence, and appropriate cellular locations. With minor improvements to evidence annotations and component locations, this would be an exemplary GO-CAM model for a metabolic pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully captures the conversion of extracellular L-fucose to intracellular GDP-L-fucose for use in glycosylation, with each step represented by the appropriate enzyme and molecular function.\n",

      "### Structural Review\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for signaling pathways:\n",

      "   - Consider representing the phosphorylation events involved. Based on the literature, CD226 engagement leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of GRB2. This molecular detail could be added.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Additional pathway components**:\n",
      "   - The role of LFA-1, which cooperates with CD226 in triggering cytotoxicity (as mentioned in PMID:15039383), could be incorporated.\n",
      "   - The connection to downstream effector mechanisms of NK cell cytotoxicity (perforin/granzyme release) could be added to make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complex formation**:\n",
      "   - According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, if specific activities are carried out by a complex (rather than individual proteins), this should be represented. \n",
      "   - The literature suggests that CD226 forms complexes with other molecules upon activation, which could be captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Downstream consequences**:\n",
      "   - The model could be extended to include the ultimate outcomes of this pathway, such as target cell lysis or cytokine production.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",

      "\n",
      "**Title:** Activation of the integrated stress response via activation of EIF2AK3/PERK in response to unfolded protein response (Human)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Taxon:** Human (NCBITaxon:9606)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Status:** Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the PERK-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, a branch of the integrated stress response (ISR). The model depicts how endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates EIF2AK3/PERK, which then phosphorylates and inhibits eIF2α (EIF2S1), leading to the translation of specific stress-responsive mRNAs including ATF4, which functions as a transcription factor in the nucleus to activate stress response genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model accurately captures the key molecular events in the PERK-mediated UPR pathway.\n",
      "2. The causal relationships between activities are appropriately represented with the correct predicates.\n",

      "4. All activities are localized to the correct cellular compartments.\n",
      "5. The model clearly indicates the biological processes each molecular function is part of.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Components of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four key molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **EIF2AK3/PERK kinase activity** (GO:0004694) enabled by UniProtKB:Q9NZJ5, occurring in the ER membrane (GO:0005789), part of the PERK-mediated UPR (GO:0036499).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **EIF2S1/eIF2α translation initiation factor activity** (GO:0003743) enabled by UniProtKB:P05198, occurring in the cytosol (GO:0005829), part of translational initiation (GO:0006413). This appears in two instances in the model - one active and one inhibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **ATF4 transcription factor activity** (GO:0003700) enabled by UniProtKB:P18848, occurring in the nucleus (GO:0005634), part of the PERK-mediated UPR (GO:0036499).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model uses appropriate causal predicates:\n",
      "- PERK (EIF2AK3) directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) EIF2S1/eIF2α\n",
      "- PERK (EIF2AK3) directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) EIF2S1/eIF2α\n",
      "- EIF2S1/eIF2α indirectly provides input for (RO:0002407) ATF4 transcription factor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conformance to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using appropriate activity terms for each protein\n",
      "2. Correctly representing the cellular locations of each activity\n",
      "3. Using the appropriate causal predicates for signaling relationships\n",
      "4. Including supporting evidence from the literature for each assertion\n",
      "5. Properly connecting activities to the relevant biological processes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clarify Dual Regulation of EIF2S1**: The model shows PERK both positively and negatively regulating EIF2S1. While this reflects the biological reality (PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which inhibits general translation but selectively enhances translation of specific mRNAs like ATF4), it might be clearer to annotate these distinct activities more explicitly. The model shows two EIF2S1 nodes with the same GO term (GO:0003743), but perhaps these could be annotated differently to better distinguish between the two states or activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expand Downstream Effects**: The model could be expanded to include more downstream effects of ATF4 activation, such as the transcriptional activation of specific target genes (e.g., CHOP/DDIT3, GADD34/PPP1R15A) that are important in the integrated stress response.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include Regulatory Mechanisms**: The model could include more detail about how PERK itself is activated, such as its dimerization/oligomerization and autophosphorylation in response to ER stress, as well as its regulation by BiP/GRP78.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connection to Other UPR Branches**: The model focuses on the PERK branch of the UPR, but connections to the other branches (IRE1 and ATF6) could be included to provide a more comprehensive view of the UPR.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Accuracy of the Biology\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately reflects the current understanding of the PERK-mediated UPR pathway as described in the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. PERK is correctly shown as a kinase activated by ER stress\n",
      "2. PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which both inhibits general protein translation and selectively enhances translation of specific mRNAs like ATF4\n",
      "3. ATF4 is accurately depicted as a transcription factor that operates in the nucleus to activate stress response genes\n",
      "4. The cellular locations of these activities are accurate: PERK in the ER membrane, eIF2α in the cytosol, and ATF4 in the nucleus\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence cited (PMIDs 16289705, 10026192, 11960987, 15109498, 23123191, 31023583, and 32132707) provides strong support for the relationships depicted in the model.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM represents a pathway where EIF2AK3/PERK (pancreatic eIF-2α kinase) phosphorylates NFE2L2/NRF2 during the unfolded protein response, which prevents NFE2L2/NRF2 from being ubiquitinated by the KEAP1-RBX1 complex. This allows NFE2L2/NRF2 to translocate to the nucleus where it can function as a DNA-binding transcription factor involved in the response to oxidative stress.\n",

      "## Components and Activities in the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model describes four main activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **EIF2AK3 (UniProtKB:Q9NZJ5)** - Protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674)\n",
      "   - Part of the PERK-mediated unfolded protein response (GO:0036499)\n",

      "   - Occurs in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - Part of proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **RBX1 (UniProtKB:P62877)** - Ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",
      "   - Occurs in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "   - Part of proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0043161)\n",

      "   - Part of response to oxidative stress (GO:0006979)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **EIF2AK3 → KEAP1**: EIF2AK3 phosphorylation activity [RO:0012010] enables KEAP1's ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **KEAP1 → RBX1**: KEAP1 directly positively regulates [RO:0002629] RBX1's ubiquitin protein ligase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **RBX1 → NFE2L2**: RBX1 directly negatively regulates [RO:0002630] NFE2L2's DNA-binding transcription factor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence and References\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is supported by several primary research articles:\n",
      "- PMID:10026192 - Characterization of PERK and its functions in pancreatic islets\n",
      "- PMID:15601839 - KEAP1 targeting NRF2 for ubiquitination\n",

      "\n",
      "## Model Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Appropriate evidence usage**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes and references for each assertion.\n",
      "2. **Cellular compartments**: The model correctly captures the relevant cellular locations for each protein (cytoplasm for KEAP1/RBX1 and nucleus for NFE2L2).\n",
      "3. **Biological accuracy**: The representation of PERK-mediated NFE2L2 activation is consistent with the literature. Under ER stress, PERK phosphorylates NFE2L2, preventing its degradation by the KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 complex.\n",
      "4. **Correct use of causal relationships**: The model uses appropriate relationship predicates to represent the regulatory connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "1. **Additional upstream regulators**: The model could benefit from including what activates EIF2AK3/PERK initially (unfolded proteins in the ER).\n",
      "2. **Missing CUL3 component**: The BCR(KEAP1) complex typically includes CUL3 as a core component along with KEAP1 and RBX1, but CUL3 is not included in this model.\n",
      "3. **Missing downstream targets**: The model ends with NFE2L2's transcription factor activity but doesn't include its downstream target genes that are involved in the antioxidant response.\n",
      "4. **Regulatory detail**: The model doesn't specify the mechanism by which PERK phosphorylation of NFE2L2 prevents KEAP1-mediated ubiquitination.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conformity with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows key best practices by:\n",
      "- Using appropriate GO terms for molecular functions\n",
      "- Connecting activities with causal relationships\n",
      "- Including cellular compartment information\n",
      "- Providing proper evidence codes and references\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the known biology of the PERK-NFE2L2-KEAP1 pathway:\n",
      "1. The PERK kinase is activated during the unfolded protein response.\n",
      "2. PERK phosphorylates NFE2L2, which prevents its degradation by the KEAP1-RBX1 ubiquitin ligase complex.\n",
      "3. This allows NFE2L2 to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor involved in the oxidative stress response.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between EIF2AK3 and NFE2L2 is biologically consistent with literature showing that PERK activation during ER stress leads to NFE2L2 phosphorylation and subsequent activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a solid GO-CAM model representing the PERK-NFE2L2-KEAP1 pathway in humans. It accurately captures the core components and relationships in this pathway, which is important for the cellular response to both ER stress and oxidative stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations for improvement:\n",
      "1. Add CUL3 as a component of the BCR(KEAP1) complex for a more complete representation.\n",
      "2. Include some downstream target genes of NFE2L2 to better represent the antioxidant response.\n",
      "3. Specify the phosphorylation sites on NFE2L2 targeted by PERK if known.\n",
      "4. Add more detailed information about the cellular conditions that activate PERK (accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this model effectively represents an important pathway involved in the cellular stress response and has a good foundation that can be expanded to include additional regulatory details and downstream effectors.\n",

      "This model describes the molecular interactions involved in natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity through the NECTIN2 (CD112) and CD226 (DNAM-1) receptor-ligand pathway, leading to GRB2 adaptor protein recruitment and subsequent VAV1 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Components of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four main molecular activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **NECTIN2 (Q92692)**: Receptor ligand activity (GO:0048018)\n",
      "2. **CD226 (Q15762)**: Signaling receptor activity (GO:0038023)\n",
      "3. **GRB2 (P62993)**: Protein-macromolecule adaptor activity (GO:0030674)\n",
      "4. **VAV1 (P15498)**: Guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity (GO:0005085)\n",
      "\n",
      "All these components participate in the biological process of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (GO:0042267).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows three causal relationships with \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) predicate:\n",
      "1. NECTIN2 (receptor ligand) → CD226 (signaling receptor)\n",
      "2. CD226 (signaling receptor) → GRB2 (adaptor protein)\n",
      "3. GRB2 (adaptor protein) → VAV1 (guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor)\n",
      "\n",
      "This creates a linear signaling cascade where NECTIN2 binding to CD226 triggers downstream adaptor protein recruitment and eventual activation of VAV1.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Cellular Locations\n",
      "\n",
      "- NECTIN2 activity occurs at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "- CD226 activity occurs at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "- GRB2 activity occurs in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "- VAV1 activity occurs in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "Each activity and causal relationship is supported by experimental evidence:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The NECTIN2-CD226 interaction is supported by direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) from PMID:15607800\n",

      "\n",
      "## Biological Significance\n",
      "\n",
      "This model captures an important biological pathway in NK cell activation. When NECTIN2 (CD112) on a target cell binds to CD226 (DNAM-1) on an NK cell, it triggers a signaling cascade that contributes to natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This interaction is particularly important in immune surveillance against tumor cells that express NECTIN2.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Quality Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the signaling pathway from NECTIN2-CD226 binding to VAV1 activation.\n",
      "2. Each component and relationship is supported by published experimental evidence.\n",
      "3. Cellular locations are correctly annotated for all molecules.\n",
      "4. The biological process (NK cell cytotoxicity) is correctly associated with all activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Protein Relationships**: The literature indicates that CD226 can also interact with PVR (CD155) as another ligand. While the model focuses specifically on the NECTIN2-CD226 pathway, a note about this alternative pathway could be useful for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Downstream Signaling**: The model stops at VAV1 activation, but the literature indicates further downstream effects through the RAS/MAPK pathway. Extending the model to include these downstream effects would provide a more complete picture of the signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Alternative Downstream Pathways**: The literature suggests that CD226 signaling can also lead to PI3K/AKT pathway activation, which is not represented in this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular Details**: The model doesn't capture the details of how CD226 activates GRB2. According to the literature, CD226 must be phosphorylated by Src family kinases to recruit GRB2, which then leads to activation of VAV1.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Timing and Context**: The model doesn't capture the context in which this pathway is activated, such as the presence of other co-stimulatory or inhibitory signals that might modulate NK cell activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Model Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider adding details about the phosphorylation of CD226 by Src family kinases before GRB2 recruitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Include a note or representation of the alternative ligand PVR (CD155) that can also bind to CD226.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Extend the model to include downstream effects of VAV1 activation, particularly the activation of small GTPases like RAC1 that lead to cytoskeletal reorganization and NK cell activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider adding parallel pathways that might be activated by CD226 signaling, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Add information about how this pathway intersects with other pathways in NK cell activation to provide a more comprehensive view of NK cell cytotoxicity.\n",

      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model `gomodel:66b5638000001291` accurately represents the core pathway of NECTIN2-CD226 mediated NK cell cytotoxicity from ligand binding to VAV1 activation.

      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents a pathway depicting how endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4 signaling axis to promote the expression of COX7A2L/SCAF1, which increases the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes in human cells.\n",

      "\"Activation of the integrated stress response via activation of EIF2AK3/PERK in response to unfolded protein response promotes expression of COX7A2L/SCAF1, increasing formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes (Human).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four primary activities connected through causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **EIF2AK3/PERK Activity**:\n",
      "   - Enabled by: UniProtKB:Q9NZJ5 (EIF2AK3/PERK)\n",
      "   - Molecular function: GO:0004694 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity)\n",

      "\n",
      "## Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes the following causal relationships:\n",
      "1. EIF2AK3/PERK directly negatively regulates EIF2S1 Activity #1 (RO:0002630)\n",
      "2. EIF2AK3/PERK directly positively regulates EIF2S1 Activity #2 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "3. EIF2S1 Activity #2 directly provides input for ATF4 Activity (RO:0002407)\n",
      "4. ATF4 directly provides input for COX7A2L Activity (RO:0002407)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Review Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate Representation of Signaling Cascade**: The model correctly depicts the PERK-eIF2alpha-ATF4 signaling axis that is activated in response to ER stress. This is supported by the primary literature citing how PERK activation phosphorylates eIF2alpha, which leads to selective translation of ATF4.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct Molecular Functions**: The molecular functions assigned to each protein are appropriate. PERK is correctly annotated with kinase activity, eIF2alpha with translation initiation factor activity, ATF4 with transcription factor activity, and COX7A2L with protein-macromolecule adaptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate Cellular Localization**: Each protein is accurately localized within the cell: PERK at the ER membrane, eIF2alpha in the cytosol, ATF4 in the nucleus, and COX7A2L at the mitochondrial inner membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Well-Supported Pathway**: The pathway described is well-supported by the primary literature, particularly the paper by Balsa et al. (2019) which demonstrates that PERK activation leads to ATF4-mediated transcription of COX7A2L/SCAF1, promoting respiratory supercomplex formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Proper Causal Relationships**: The causal relationships between the activities are accurately represented. PERK has a dual effect on eIF2alpha (negatively regulating general translation but promoting specific translation of stress response genes), which is correctly captured by the two separate arrows (RO:0002630 and RO:0002629).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dual EIF2S1 Activities**: While the model correctly represents that PERK both negatively and positively regulates eIF2alpha, having two separate EIF2S1 activities with identical annotations might be confusing. This dual representation is attempting to capture how phosphorylated eIF2alpha inhibits global translation (Activity #1) while promoting translation of specific mRNAs like ATF4 (Activity #2). A more precise annotation might differentiate these activities more clearly, perhaps by adding state information to the activities or annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing Environmental Context**: The model doesn't explicitly represent the initial environmental stimulus (ER stress) that activates PERK. Adding this context would provide a more complete representation of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Detail on COX7A2L Function**: The model could be enhanced with more detail on how COX7A2L/SCAF1 specifically promotes respiratory supercomplex formation. From the paper by Perez-Perez et al. (2016), SCAF1 functions as an adaptor that mediates the association between complexes III and IV. This mechanistic detail could be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing Intermediate Steps**: The model simplifies the mechanism by which ATF4 regulates COX7A2L. Adding the transcriptional activation step explicitly would make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Molecular Complexes Representation**: According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, when a protein like COX7A2L serves as an adaptor between complexes, it might be valuable to represent the actual respiratory complexes (III and IV) in the model to show how SCAF1 mediates their interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by primary literature, particularly:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The PMID:31023583 (Balsa et al., 2019) which directly shows the PERK-eIF2alpha-ATF4 axis promoting COX7A2L expression and supercomplex formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The PMID:27545886 (Perez-Perez et al., 2016) which characterizes COX7A2L/SCAF1 as a protein that stabilizes the III2+IV supercomplex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each activity has appropriate evidence codes and references to primary literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM curation guidelines in terms of:\n",
      "- Using appropriate molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes\n",
      "- Properly representing causal relationships between activities\n",
      "- Attributing activities to the correct gene products\n",
      "\n",
      "The model could better follow guidelines regarding complex representation as mentioned in \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM,\" especially when dealing with macromolecular adaptors like COX7A2L.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model 66b5638000001589 provides a clear and scientifically accurate representation of how PERK activation leads to increased respiratory supercomplex formation via ATF4-mediated expression of COX7A2L/SCAF1. The model correctly captures the cellular locations, molecular functions, and causal relationships between the components of this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are some areas for potential refinement, particularly in the representation of dual eIF2alpha activities and in providing more mechanistic detail for how COX7A2L promotes supercomplex formation, the model successfully conveys the key aspects of this signaling pathway in a manner that aligns with GO-CAM best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pathway represents an important mechanism by which cells adapt to ER stress by enhancing mitochondrial respiratory efficiency, highlighting the integration between cellular stress responses and energy metabolism.\n",

      "## Assessment Against GO-CAM Standards:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Overall Structure and Signal Flow\n",
      "The model correctly represents a GPCR signaling pathway with appropriate causal relationships:\n",
      "- CALCA (ligand) positively regulates CALCR (receptor)\n",
      "- RAMP2 (coreceptor) positively regulates CALCR (receptor)\n",
      "- CALCR positively regulates GNAS (G protein)\n",
      "- GNAS positively regulates ADCY6 (adenylate cyclase)\n",
      "- ADCY6 has output of cAMP\n",
      "\n",
      "This flow aligns with canonical GPCR signaling pathways and uses appropriate predicates for causal associations (RO:0002629 \"directly positively regulates\").\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Receptor Complex Representation\n",
      "The model correctly represents the AMYR2 receptor complex as recommended in the GO-CAM guidelines. CALCR and RAMP2 are represented separately with their respective activities, with RAMP2 having coreceptor activity that directly positively regulates CALCR's receptor activity. This is consistent with the guidelines for annotating complexes and receptor/coreceptor relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Cellular Localization\n",
      "Appropriate cellular components are assigned:\n",
      "- CALCA is located in the extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "- CALCR and RAMP2 are located in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "- GNAS is located in the cytosol (GO:0005829)\n",
      "\n",
      "These locations are consistent with the biological roles of these proteins in signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Biological Process Context\n",
      "The model appropriately places:\n",
      "- CALCA and RAMP2 in the \"amylin receptor 2 signaling pathway\" (GO:0150060)\n",
      "- CALCR, GNAS, and ADCY6 in the \"adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway\" (GO:0007189)\n",
      "\n",
      "This correctly represents the nested pathway structure in GPCR signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Evidence Support\n",
      "All activities in the model are supported by experimental evidence codes (primarily ECO:0000314 \"direct assay evidence used in manual assertion\") and referenced to primary literature (PMIDs).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Current Knowledge:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately reflects current knowledge about calcitonin signaling through the AMYR2 receptor complex:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CALCR-RAMP2 complex formation**: The interaction between CALCR and RAMP2 to form the AMYR2 receptor complex is well-established in the literature (supported by PMID:35324283).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ligand specificity**: The model correctly shows calcitonin (CALCA) as a ligand for the AMYR2 complex, which is supported by recent structural biology studies (PMID:35324283).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream signaling**: The activation of G protein (GNAS) and subsequent stimulation of adenylate cyclase (ADCY6) leading to cAMP production is consistent with the canonical signaling pathway for this receptor type.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process annotation**: The placement of the receptor complex components in the \"amylin receptor 2 signaling pathway\" is appropriate, as the CALCR-RAMP2 complex is known to respond to both calcitonin and amylin.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Points for Additional Consideration:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model does not include downstream signaling events from cAMP (such as PKA activation), which could potentially be added in future expansions of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The specific isoform of GNAS being used could potentially be clarified if known, as multiple isoforms exist with different functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:66b5638000001665 is a well-constructed representation of calcitonin signaling through the AMYR2 receptor complex. It adheres to GO-CAM best practices for representing receptor-ligand interactions, complex formation, and GPCR signaling. The model includes appropriate molecular functions, cellular locations, and biological processes for all components, with evidence-supported causal relationships that correctly depict the flow of signaling information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with current scientific understanding of calcitonin signaling and appropriately represents the roles of CALCR and RAMP2 in forming the AMYR2 receptor complex. All activities are well-supported by primary literature references and appropriate evidence codes.\n",

      "5. The evidence provided for each association is robust, with multiple primary literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Phosphorylation Sites Representation:** The model doesn't explicitly indicate that AKT1 phosphorylates PERK at Thr-802, which is the mechanism by which it inhibits PERK activity (as described in the UniProt entry for PERK). Adding this molecular detail would enhance the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Representation of EIF2S1 Phosphorylation:** While the model shows PERK negatively regulating EIF2S1, it would be more precise to indicate that PERK phosphorylates EIF2S1 at Ser-52, which then leads to translational inhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Upstream Activators:** The model doesn't include what activates AKT1 in the context of ER stress. Adding this context would provide a more complete picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing Pathway Components:** The model doesn't include some important components of the PERK pathway such as:\n",
      "   - GADD34/PPP1R15A which provides negative feedback\n",
      "   - CHOP/DDIT3 which is induced by ATF4 and involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **ATF4 Transcriptional Targets:** The model stops at ATF4 activation but doesn't show any of its downstream targets such as SCAF1/COX7A2L (as described in the paper by Balsa et al., 2019), which would provide more context about the biological outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Integrated Stress Response Context:** The model doesn't fully contextualize that PERK is part of the broader integrated stress response (ISR), which can be activated by multiple stressors beyond ER stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Potential Duplication:** There are two identical activities for EIF2S1 (entries #3 and #5 in the components list), which seems redundant unless they represent different instances/populations of the same protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is biologically accurate in depicting the core regulatory relationship between AKT1 and PERK. The evidence provided comes from multiple peer-reviewed publications, strengthening the model's validity. The relationships shown align with current understanding of the PERK branch of the UPR pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as noted above, including more molecular details (such as specific phosphorylation sites) and extending the model to include more downstream components would improve its comprehensiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Modeling Guidelines Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model generally follows GO-CAM modeling guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It uses appropriate molecular function GO terms for each protein.\n",
      "2. It accurately represents cellular locations.\n",
      "3. It uses appropriate causal relationship predicates (RO terms).\n",
      "4. It includes proper evidence for each assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, regarding how complexes are annotated, since the model doesn't explicitly represent any protein complexes, it doesn't fully leverage the guidance provided in the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document. For a more comprehensive representation, it might be worth considering if any of the proteins act as part of complexes (e.g., eIF2 is typically a complex of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "To enhance this GO-CAM model, I recommend:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Phosphorylation Details:** Specify that AKT1 phosphorylates PERK at Thr-802 and that PERK phosphorylates EIF2S1 at Ser-52.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Resolve the Duplication:** Remove or distinguish between the two identical EIF2S1 activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Extend the Pathway:** Consider adding:\n",
      "   - Upstream regulators of AKT1 in the context of ER stress\n",
      "   - Downstream targets of ATF4 (especially SCAF1/COX7A2L)\n",
      "   - The negative feedback loop involving GADD34/PPP1R15A\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Complex Representation:** Evaluate if representing eIF2 as a complex would be more appropriate than just showing the alpha subunit.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add Physiological Context:** Include annotations that connect this regulatory pathway to its physiological outcomes, such as how AKT1-mediated inhibition of PERK affects cell survival during ER stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model gomodel:66b5638000001719 \"AKT1 inhibits EIF2AK3/PERK (Human)\" is a valuable representation of a key regulatory relationship in the PERK branch of the UPR pathway. While it accurately captures the core elements of this regulation, adding more molecular details and extending the pathway representation would enhance its comprehensiveness and utility for the scientific community.\n",

According to the document \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\", this is the correct approach when the subunits carrying specific activities are known.\n",

      "The model represents a signaling cascade where:\n",
      "1. GRM1 activates GNAQ\n",
      "2. GNAQ activates PLCB3\n",
      "3. PLCB3 generates second messengers (IP3 and DAG)\n",
      "4. PRKCG (activated by DAG and calcium) provides input for GRID2\n",
      "\n",
      "This pathway accurately represents the canonical phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, where GRM1 (mGlu1) activates GRID2 via the GNAQ-PLC-PKC pathway, as supported by the literature (particularly PMID:27276689).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular functions**: Each protein is assigned appropriate molecular functions based on current knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct subcellular localization**: The subcellular locations are accurately represented, with GRM1 and GRID2 at the postsynaptic density membrane, and GNAQ, PLCB3, and PRKCG in the postsynaptic cytosol.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complete signaling pathway**: The model captures the entire signaling cascade from receptor activation to the final effector.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence-based annotations**: The annotations are supported by published literature, including experimental evidence from PMIDs 24357660, 27276689, 37991948, and 23115168.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Correct causal relationships**: The causal relationships between components are accurately represented using appropriate relationship ontology terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **IP3 effect could be expanded**: The model doesn't explicitly show the effect of IP3 on calcium release, which is part of the PKC activation mechanism. This could be included to make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular complex representation**: The model does not represent any protein complexes. While this is appropriate based on the current evidence, if future research identifies specific complexes involved in this pathway, they could be included according to GO-CAM complex annotation guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback mechanisms**: The model doesn't include any feedback mechanisms that might regulate this signaling pathway, which could be added if supported by evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using appropriate GO terms for molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes\n",
      "2. Using correct relationship ontology terms for causal relationships\n",
      "3. Including evidence codes and references for annotations\n",
      "4. Maintaining consistency between molecular functions and their biological context\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy and Significance\n",
      "\n",
      "This model accurately captures the current understanding of how mGluR1 (GRM1) activates GRID2 via the GNAQ-PLC-PKC signaling pathway in Purkinje cells. The literature supports that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. GRM1 activation stimulates GNAQ (PMID:27276689)\n",
      "2. GNAQ activates PLCB3, leading to production of IP3 and DAG (PMID:37991948)\n",
      "3. DAG and calcium activate PRKCG (PMID:23115168)\n",
      "4. PRKCG contributes to GRID2 channel activation (PMIDs:24357660, 27276689)\n",
      "\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model describes a signaling pathway in which GRIM1 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 1, GRM1/Grm1) activates GRID1 via GNAQ (Gq) in dopamine neurons in mouse. The model shows how dopamine neurons employ a metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling pathway to regulate glutamate receptor delta-1 channel activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "The model contains four main activities:\n",
      "1. MGI:MGI:1351338 (Grm1) with GO:0099530 (G protein-coupled receptor activity involved in regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential)\n",
      "2. MGI:MGI:95776 (Gnaq) with GO:0003925 (G protein activity)\n",
      "3. MGI:MGI:104778 (Plcb3) with GO:0004435 (phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C activity)\n",
      "4. MGI:MGI:97597 (Prkcg) with GO:0004698 (calcium,diacylglycerol-dependent serine/threonine kinase activity)\n",
      "5. MGI:MGI:95812 (Grid1) with GO:1904315 (transmitter-gated monoatomic ion channel activity involved in regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "1. The model accurately represents the molecular function and causal relationships between key signaling components based on recent literature.\n",
      "2. The cellular components are correctly annotated, with most activities occurring in the postsynaptic compartment.\n",
      "3. The causal relationships follow the canonical signaling pathway from GPCR activation to channel opening.\n",
      "4. The model is grounded in evidence from multiple published studies, with each relationship having supporting evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inconsistent cellular localization**: While the model specifies postsynaptic cytosol (GO:0099524) for most components, it would be more accurate to place GRID1 in the postsynaptic density membrane (GO:0098839) where it functions, which is noted for some activities but not all.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological process annotation**: The model shows Grm1 and Gnaq being part of GO:0007200 (phospholipase C-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway), which is appropriate. However, Grid1 is annotated as part of GO:0099538 (synaptic signaling via neuropeptide), which doesn't seem as precise as possible for this pathway. A term more related to glutamatergic signaling would be more appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Input-output relationships**: The model shows outputs from Plcb3 activity (CHEBI:203600 - inositol triphosphate and CHEBI:17815 - diacylglycerol), but doesn't explicitly connect these outputs as inputs to the downstream Prkcg (PKC) activity, which would improve the model connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing intermediates**: The research suggests that additional components might be involved in complex formation (such as TRPC3), but these are not represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signaling pathway**: The model correctly represents the G protein-coupled receptor mGluR1 (Grm1) activating Gq (Gnaq), which activates PLC-beta3 (Plcb3), leading to PKC-gamma (Prkcg) activation and ultimately the regulation of the GluD1 (Grid1) channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The model accurately represents directionality using appropriate predicates. The causal flow from Grm1 → Gnaq → Plcb3 → Prkcg → Grid1 is supported by the literature, particularly the papers by Dadak et al. (2016) and Ady et al. (2014).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Localization**: The model correctly places these interactions in the postsynaptic compartment of dopamine neurons, which aligns with the expression patterns described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence**: The model appropriately cites primary literature for each relationship, including PMID:27276689, PMID:28696429, and PMID:23115168.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Update cellular location for GRID1**: Ensure consistency in cellular annotations for GRID1, which should be in the postsynaptic density membrane (GO:0098839).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add second messenger relationships**: The model could explicitly show how the second messengers (IP3 and DAG) connect to PKC activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider adding TRPC3**: Based on the literature (PMID:23115168), TRPC3 appears to be part of the complex with mGluR1 and GluD1. Including this protein would enhance the model's completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Revise biological process annotation for GRID1**: Consider replacing GO:0099538 (synaptic signaling via neuropeptide) with a more appropriate term related to glutamate signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add specific phosphorylation targets**: If the literature supports it, the model could be enhanced by specifying the phosphorylation targets of PKC on GRID1.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model effectively captures the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway by which mGluR1 activates GluD1 channels in dopamine neurons, a pathway that appears important for neuronal firing patterns. The model is scientifically sound and well-supported by evidence. With the suggested minor improvements, it would provide an even more comprehensive representation of this signaling pathway that plays an important role in dopamine neuron function and potentially in disorders like schizophrenia, where GRID1 mutations have been implicated.\n",

      "### Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model effectively captures the signaling cascade from receptor activation through G protein signaling to downstream effectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate use of causal relations**: The model uses the correct predicates to represent the causal relationships between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Well-supported by evidence**: Most annotations are backed by direct experimental evidence and appropriate literature references.\n",

      "### Areas for Potential Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**: While this model doesn't explicitly represent any protein complexes, it correctly follows the GO-CAM guidelines for representing the individual proteins carrying specific activities rather than representing the complex as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Feedback loops**: The model could potentially be enhanced by including any feedback mechanisms that might exist in this signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream effects**: The model could be extended to show how PKC activation ultimately affects cellular processes beyond regulation of GRID1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Alternative evidence for GRID1 channel activity**: The ion channel activity of GRID1 is supported only by sequence similarity evidence. According to the UniProt entry for GRID1 (Q9ULK0), there is now controversy about this activity (noted under CAUTION: \"The ligand-gated cation channel activity triggered by glycine and D-serine, first reported in an article, has been a subject of controversy\"). Recent research (PubMed:39052831) has disputed this ligand-gated cation channel activity.\n",

      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"GRIM1 activates GRID1 via GNAQ in dopamine neurons (Human)\" (gomodel:66b5638000002630) is a well-constructed, evidence-based representation of a G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway in dopamine neurons. The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular functions, cellular components, and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully captures a signaling cascade from GRID1 receptor activation, through GNAQ G protein function, to phospholipase C activation and subsequent second messenger generation, with protein kinase C serving as a feedback regulator.\n",

      "The evidence used to support the annotations is strong, with most activities supported by direct experimental evidence. While there could be some potential updates regarding the controversy around GRID1's ion channel activity, the overall structure of the model is sound.\n",

      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:66b5638000002701](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:66b5638000002701) is titled \"IL13RA2-mediated alternative IL13 pathway leading to TGFB1 production (Human)\" and describes a signaling pathway in humans ([NCBITaxon:9606](https://bioregistry.io/NCBITaxon:9606)) where IL-13 signals through the IL-13Rα2 receptor to ultimately lead to TGF-β1 production.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four main activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **IL-13 cytokine activity** (enabled by [UniProtKB:P35225](https://bioregistry.io/UniProtKB:P35225))\n",

      "\n",
      "The causal relationships in the model are:\n",
      "- IL-13 directly positively regulates IL-13Rα2\n",
      "- IL-13Rα2 directly positively regulates the AP-1 complex and has input into the AP-1 complex\n",
      "- AP-1 complex has target response element activity toward the TGF-β1 protein\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the literature. The primary citation ([PMID:16327802](https://bioregistry.io/pubmed:16327802)) provides detailed experimental evidence showing that IL-13 signaling through IL-13Rα2 activates an AP-1 complex (containing c-Jun and Fra-2) which then activates TGF-β1 production. This finding was significant because IL-13Rα2 was previously considered only a decoy receptor.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Cellular Location Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly places:\n",
      "- IL-13 in the extracellular space ([GO:0005615](https://bioregistry.io/GO:0005615))\n",
      "- IL-13Rα2 at the plasma membrane ([GO:0005886](https://bioregistry.io/GO:0005886))\n",

      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationships in the model accurately reflect the biology described in the literature:\n",
      "- IL-13 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) IL-13Rα2 activity\n",
      "- IL-13Rα2 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) and directly provides input for (RO:0002409) the AP-1 complex\n",
      "- AP-1 complex has target response element activity toward (RO:0002407) TGF-β1\n",
      "\n",
      "This matches the mechanism described by Fichtner-Feigl et al. (2006), who demonstrated that IL-13 signals through IL-13Rα2 to activate an AP-1 complex containing c-Jun and Fra-2, which then activates the TGFB1 promoter.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate representation of a novel signaling pathway**: The model correctly captures the alternative pathway of IL-13 signaling through IL-13Rα2, which was a significant discovery showing that IL-13Rα2 is not just a decoy receptor but has signaling capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate protein complex formation**: The AP-1 transcription factor is correctly modeled as a complex comprising c-Jun (P05412) and Fra-2 (P15408), as identified in the research paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Well-supported by experimental evidence**: Each component and relationship in the model is supported by published experimental evidence.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Biologically meaningful connections**: The model makes biologically meaningful connections between IL-13 signaling and TGF-β1 production, with implications for fibrosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional context on TNF-α role**: Although outside the direct scope of this pathway, the primary reference indicates that TNF-α is required for the induction of IL-13Rα2 expression before IL-13 can signal through it. This could be noted in model annotations for a more complete understanding of the pathway's context.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological outcomes**: The model could potentially benefit from extending to include the biological outcomes of TGF-β1 production, such as fibrosis, which was a key finding in the research papers.\n",

      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:66b5638000002701](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:66b5638000002701) is a high-quality representation of the IL-13Rα2-mediated alternative IL-13 pathway leading to TGF-β1 production. It accurately captures the biological mechanism described in the literature with appropriate molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships. The model is well-supported by experimental evidence and follows GO-CAM best practices for representing signaling pathways and transcription factor activities.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Proteins and Activities Represented:\n",
      "1. **CALCA (P06881-1)**: Hormone activity (GO:0005179) in extracellular space\n",
      "2. **RAMP1 (O60894)**: Coreceptor activity (GO:0015026) at plasma membrane \n",

      "- RAMP1 directly positively regulates CALCR\n",
      "- CALCR directly positively regulates GNAS\n",

      "- ADCY6 is part of adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway (GO:0007189)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Scientific Accuracy**: The model is consistent with the latest research on CGRP receptor interactions, as evidenced by publications like PMID:38603770, which describes the cryo-EM structure of the AMYR1 receptor complex with CGRP.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complete Pathway Representation**: The model captures the entire signaling cascade from ligand binding through receptor activation, G protein coupling, and second messenger generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proper Evidence**: Each activity and relationship is supported by appropriate evidence with specific PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Appropriate Use of GO Terms**: The molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components used are all appropriate for the proteins in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Correct Causal Relationships**: The model uses the appropriate causal relationship \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) between activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **RAMP1 Representation**: According to the signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines, the input of a coreceptor should be the signaling receptor it regulates. However, in this model, RAMP1 directly regulates CALCR, which is consistent with its biological role but could be clarified with a more specific annotation about their complex formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Representation**: While the title mentions the CALCR-RAMP1 (AMYR1) receptor complex, the model represents CALCR and RAMP1 as separate proteins with separate activities rather than as a complex. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" document, when two proteins form a heterodimeric receptor where both activities are important (as is the case with CALCR and RAMP1), there are specific ways to represent this. The current approach is valid but could potentially benefit from clearer complex notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biological Process Annotation**: While the activities are appropriately placed in biological processes, the model would benefit from showing more explicitly how these processes relate to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the CGRP signaling pathway through the AMYR1 receptor complex. The model follows GO-CAM best practices in most respects, including the use of appropriate molecular functions, biological processes, cellular components, and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Recommended Improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consider Complex Representation**: While representing CALCR and RAMP1 as separate entities with their own activities is valid, the model might benefit from more explicitly showing their functional relationship as a complex. This could potentially be done by adding an annotation that clarifies their heterodimeric nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **RAMP1 Relationship with CALCR**: Consider clarifying the relationship between RAMP1 and CALCR to better align with the guidelines for annotating coreceptor activities, by specifying that RAMP1 enables the trafficking and ligand specificity of CALCR.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **PMIDs**: While most references are correctly cited, some PMID citations need formatting corrections (e.g., \"PMID: 2408883\" has a space that should be removed).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current scientific understanding of CGRP signaling through the AMYR1 receptor. The minor suggestions for improvement would enhance clarity but don't detract from the model's scientific accuracy.\n",

      "This GO-CAM model represents the CAAX-box protein maturation pathway in mice (NCBITaxon:10090). The model is in production status and illustrates the enzymatic cascade involved in post-translational processing of proteins containing a CAAX-box motif, which is an important process for proper membrane localization and function of many proteins including members of the RHO family.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pathway Structure\n",
      "The model effectively captures the sequential steps in CAAX-box protein maturation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The initial step involves the CAAX-protein geranylgeranyltransferase complex (GO:0005953), composed of Fnta (MGI:MGI:104683) and Pggt1b (MGI:MGI:1917514), which adds a geranylgeranyl group to the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. This is followed by Rce1 (MGI:MGI:1336895) which performs endopeptidase activity to remove the -AAX portion of the motif.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Finally, Icmt (MGI:MGI:1888594) performs the methylation of the C-terminal prenylated cysteine residue.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The model also includes a regulatory component where Musk (MGI:MGI:103581) positively regulates the initial geranylgeranyltransferase activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Support\n",
      "The model is well-supported by experimental evidence:\n",
      "- Most associations are backed by mutant phenotype evidence (ECO:0000315) or direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314)\n",
      "- The references cited (e.g., PMID:14622576, PMID:10085069, PMID:10747846) are appropriate for the process described\n",
      "- The reviewed papers support the connections between components, particularly the paper by Luo et al. (PMID:14622576) which provides solid evidence for the regulatory role of Musk in geranylgeranyltransferase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Relationships\n",
      "The causal relationships are accurately represented using appropriate predicates:\n",
      "- RO:0002413 (*provides input for*) is used correctly to connect the sequential enzymatic activities in the pathway\n",
      "- RO:0002629 (*directly positively regulates*) properly represents Musk's regulatory role on the geranylgeranyltransferase complex\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chemical Entities\n",
      "The model properly includes the relevant chemical entities:\n",
      "- CHEBI:57533 (geranylgeranyl diphosphate) as input to the first enzyme\n",
      "- CHEBI:86021 (S-geranylgeranyl-L-cysteine residue) as output of the first enzyme/input to the next\n",
      "- CHEBI:59789 (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) as a cofactor for methylation\n",
      "- CHEBI:57856 (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine) as a byproduct\n",
      "- CHEBI:87167 (S-[(2E,6E)-farnesyl]-L-cysteine methyl ester) as the final product\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quality Control Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Best Practices Compliance\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "- Activities have appropriate molecular functions, cellular components (when relevant), and biological process associations\n",
      "- Causal connections are biologically meaningful and correctly represent the pathway flow\n",
      "- The protein complex (GGTase-I) is correctly modeled with its component subunits\n",
      "\n",
      "### Parsimony and Clarity\n",
      "- The model effectively represents the essential steps in CAAX-box protein maturation without unnecessary complexity\n",
      "- The structure is clear and would be easily understandable by biologists familiar with protein prenylation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Consistency with Literature\n",
      "- The model aligns well with the key papers cited, particularly Luo et al. (PMID:14622576), which describes the role of geranylgeranyltransferase in synapse formation\n",
      "- The biological roles of these enzymes are consistent with the current understanding of CAAX-box protein processing\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is generally well-constructed, but I have a few minor recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Subcellular Location**: The Icmt activity (protein C-terminal S-isoprenylcysteine carboxyl O-methyltransferase) is correctly annotated as occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (GO:0005789), but the other activities could also benefit from cellular location annotations for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological Context**: While the model accurately represents the enzymatic pathway, adding some additional context about the biological significance of this process in mice might enhance the model's value (though this is optional).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Evidence**: For a few of the \"has_input\" and \"has_output\" associations, there isn't specific evidence listed. Adding evidence for these relationships would strengthen the model further.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "This GO-CAM model is a well-constructed representation of CAAX-box protein maturation in mice. It effectively captures the essential enzymatic steps, regulatory mechanisms, and chemical transformations involved in this process. The evidence is well-documented and the causal connections are biologically meaningful. With the minor enhancements suggested above, this would be an exemplary GO-CAM model for this important post-translational modification pathway.\n",

The model includes the following activities and their causal relationships:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CLEC12A (Q5QGZ9)** - Functions as a transmembrane signaling receptor (GO:0004888) at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), participating in negative regulation of neutrophil activation (GO:1902564)\n",

      "4. **PTPN11/SHP-2 (Q06124)** - Exhibits protein tyrosine phosphatase activity (GO:0004725) in the negative regulation of neutrophil activation process, and like PTPN6, also directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) SYK activity\n",

      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the current understanding of CLEC12A's role in neutrophil regulation as supported by literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The PMID:34234773 paper clearly establishes CLEC12A as an inhibitory receptor that negatively regulates neutrophil activation through pathways involving SRC and phosphatases\n",
      "\n",
      "2. PMID:33782605 provides evidence for SYK's role in neutrophil activation in immune responses\n",

      "3. PMID:39143217 further validates CLEC12A's role as a transmembrane signaling receptor that regulates neutrophil activation\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly depicts the cascade where CLEC12A engagement leads to SRC activation, which then activates the phosphatases PTPN6 and PTPN11, which in turn negatively regulate SYK, a key kinase involved in neutrophil activation.\n",

      "### GO-CAM Best Practices Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "The model adheres to GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Proper use of evidence codes**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes for each assertion (ECO:0000314 for direct assay evidence, ECO:0000315 for mutant phenotype evidence)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate causal relationships**: The causal relationships use proper predicates (RO:0012010 for \"causally upstream of, positive effect\" and RO:0002630 for \"directly negatively regulates\")\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular locations**: When relevant, cellular locations are specified (plasma membrane for CLEC12A)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process context**: Each molecular function is appropriately situated within a biological process context\n",
      "\n",

      "2. **Connection to downstream effects**: The model could be expanded to show downstream effects of inhibited neutrophil activation\n",

      "### Positive Aspects\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete Pathway Representation**: The model successfully captures the full heme biosynthetic pathway from 5-aminolevulinate synthase through ferrochelatase, as well as the branching pathways to heme A and siroheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Evidence**: All activities have appropriate evidence codes (ECO terms) and references (PMID or GO_REF).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct Causal Relationships**: The activities are properly connected using the \"provides input for\" predicate (RO:0002413), showing the flow of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Proper Cellular Localization**: Correct cellular compartments are specified for relevant enzymes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Input/Output Molecules**: The model appropriately includes substrate and product molecules for enzymatic reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Has_Input Annotations**: Some activities are missing explicit has_input annotations that would clarify the substrate-product relationships. For example:\n",
      "   - The ferrochelatase activity (SPCC320.09/hem15) is missing its iron input\n",
      "   - Some intermediate steps are missing explicit input molecules\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Handling**: The model doesn't include any protein complexes, but it should be verified if any of these enzymes function as complexes in S. pombe. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Potential Regulatory Relationships**: The model exclusively uses the \"provides input for\" causal relationship (RO:0002413). If any direct regulatory relationships exist (such as feedback inhibition that is common in biosynthetic pathways), these could be captured using regulatory relationships like \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) or \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Branch Points Clarity**: The branching of the pathway to siroheme biosynthesis from uroporphyrinogen III is correctly shown, but the clarity of this branch point could be improved by adding more explicit annotations about the branching relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Connectivity Check**: I notice that the ferrochelatase (hem15) appears to be an endpoint without showing connections to how heme b is further processed to heme a. The connection between the main heme synthesis path and the heme A biosynthesis branch could be made more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pathway Completeness Verification**: Check literature to ensure all known regulatory mechanisms of the pathway in S. pombe are included.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Human Readability**: While the model captures the pathway steps accurately, consider if the layout and organization optimize human understanding of the overall pathway flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Species-Specific Details**: Verify that any known S. pombe-specific aspects of heme biosynthesis are accurately captured, as there can be species-specific variations in this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that effectively represents the heme biosynthetic pathway in S. pombe. The model follows most GO-CAM best practices and provides valuable information about the molecular functions, their cellular locations, and the overall pathway organization. The suggested improvements are relatively minor and would mainly enhance the completeness and clarity of the model rather than correct any significant errors.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### 3. Evidence:\n",
      "- Most annotations are supported by sequence similarity evidence (ECO:0000250), biological aspect of ancestor evidence (ECO:0000318), or direct experimental evidence\n",
      "- References to PMID literature and orthology to known proteins in other species (especially S. cerevisiae)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pathway Flow Analysis\n",
      "The pathway is well-structured with clear \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) relationships between sequential steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Isoprenoid synthesis → Squalene synthesis (Erg9)\n",
      "2. Squalene oxidation (Erg1) → Lanosterol synthesis (Erg7)\n",
      "3. Lanosterol modification (Erg11) → Multiple sterol intermediates\n",
      "4. Sequential sterol modifications through multiple enzymes\n",
      "5. Final steps leading to ergosterol formation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quality Control Review\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Biological completeness**: The model captures the complete ergosterol biosynthesis pathway.\n",
      "2. **Molecular specificity**: Appropriate molecular functions assigned to each gene product.\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**: Clear \"provides input for\" relationships between sequential activities.\n",
      "4. **Cellular context**: Correct subcellular localization in the ER and ER membrane.\n",
      "5. **Evidence quality**: Good use of multiple evidence codes and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Minor issues:\n",
      "1. **Duplicate causal relationships**: Some activities have duplicate causal associations with the same predicate and target, one with evidence and one without. For example:\n",
      "   - Between SPBC3F6.02c (Erg26) → SPBC1709.07 (Erg27)\n",
      "   - Between SPBC16E9.05 (Erg6) → SPBC20G8.07c (Erg2)\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Molecular inputs/outputs**: While some activities have specific chemical inputs/outputs defined (e.g., lanosterol, ergosterol), not all intermediate metabolites are explicitly defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regulatory connections**: One positive regulation relationship exists (Ccr1 directly positively regulates Erg11), but the model could potentially benefit from additional regulatory relationships if biologically relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Literature Consistency\n",
      "The model uses multiple literature references (PMID:18310029, PMID:23145048, PMID:23737303, PMID:16823372) that support the ergosterol biosynthetic process in *S. pombe*. The enzyme functions and pathway organization are consistent with established knowledge of fungal sterol biosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing biochemical pathways:\n",
      "- Each activity is enabled by a specific gene product\n",
      "- Activities are connected with appropriate causal predicates\n",
      "- Cellular components are specified\n",
      "- The biological process context is provided\n",
      "- Evidence is provided for most assertions\n",
      "\n",
      "### Parsimony and Human Understanding\n",
      "The model is well-organized and represents the pathway in a way that would be clear to users familiar with sterol biosynthesis. The linear flow through sterol modifications is logically presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Remove duplicate causal relationships**: The duplicate causal associations without evidence should be removed.\n",
      "2. **Add metabolite details**: Consider adding all intermediate metabolites as inputs/outputs for a more complete representation.\n",
      "3. **Verify consistency of enzyme order**: Confirm that the sequence of enzyme activities matches the accepted ergosterol biosynthetic pathway in fungi.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:66c7d41500002088](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:66c7d41500002088)) provides a comprehensive and scientifically accurate representation of the ergosterol biosynthetic process in *S. pombe*. With minor improvements to remove duplicate relationships and possibly add more metabolite details, it would be an excellent reference model for fungal sterol biosynthesis. The model is biologically sound, supported by appropriate evidence, and follows GO-CAM best practices.\n",

      "## Overview of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the pathway by which DDX39A inhibits immune-related RNA export to the cytoplasm in humans. The model includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. DDX39A (RNA helicase) with RNA binding activity and its role in the negative regulation of RNA export from the nucleus\n",
      "2. RANBP2 (E3 SUMO-protein ligase) and its SUMO ligase activity's effect on DDX39A\n",
      "3. TRAF3 (E3 ubiquitin ligase) and its role in toll-like receptor signaling\n",

      "\n",
      "## Structure of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts the following causal pathway:\n",
      "- RANBP2 directly negatively regulates DDX39A through SUMOylation\n",
      "- DDX39A RNA binding activity serves as a checkpoint, providing input for:\n",
      "  - TRAF3 ubiquitin ligase activity in the endosome\n",
      "  - TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase activity in the cytoplasm\n",
      "  - MAVS signaling adaptor activity in the mitochondrial outer membrane\n",
      "\n",
      "## Molecular Details Assessment\n",

      "### DDX39A (O00148)\n",
      "- **Molecular Function**: RNA binding (GO:0003723)\n",
      "- **Biological Process**: Negative regulation of RNA export from the nucleus (GO:0046832)\n",
      "- **Cellular Component**: Nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "\n",
      "This appears to be appropriate based on the UniProt data, which confirms DDX39A functions in mRNA export and plays a role in negative regulation of type I IFN production by increasing nuclear retention of antiviral transcripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### RANBP2 (P49792)\n",
      "- **Molecular Function**: SUMO ligase activity (GO:0061665)\n",
      "- **Biological Process**: Protein sumoylation (GO:0016925)\n",
      "- **Cellular Component**: Nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "\n",
      "This annotation is appropriate since RANBP2 is an E3 SUMO-protein ligase that facilitates SUMO1 and SUMO2 conjugation, and is located at the nuclear pore complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "### TRAF3 (Q13114)\n",
      "- **Molecular Function**: Ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630)\n",

      "- **Cellular Component**: Endosome (GO:0005768)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is appropriate as TRAF3 is a cytoplasmic E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates various signaling pathways including TLR signaling, and UniProt data confirms it can be localized to endosomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### TRAF6 (Q9Y4K3)\n",

      "This is appropriate based on TRAF6's known role in pattern recognition receptor signaling.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Causal Relations Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model shows that DDX39A's RNA binding activity \"provides input for\" (RO:0002409) several downstream signaling components involved in immune response:\n",
      "- MAVS signaling adaptor activity\n",
      "- TRAF3 ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "- TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the available literature, this appears to represent DDX39A's role in binding and controlling the export of specific mRNAs, including those encoding immune response components.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal relationship between RANBP2 and DDX39A (\"directly negatively regulates\", RO:0002630) represents the SUMOylation of DDX39A by RANBP2, which is known to alter DDX39A's RNA binding ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately captures the pathway described in the scientific literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. DDX39A functions as a negative regulator of innate immune signaling by binding to and sequestering immune-related transcripts in the nucleus.\n",
      "2. SUMOylation of DDX39A by RANBP2 alters its binding specificity and export activity, which impacts the immune response.\n",
      "3. The mRNAs affected include those encoding key immune signaling components like TRAF3, TRAF6, and MAVS.\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Best Practices Review\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Activity representation**: Each gene product is annotated with a specific molecular function that it enables.\n",
      "2. **Contextual annotation**: All activities are annotated with both biological process and cellular component contexts.\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**: Appropriate causal predicates are used to connect the activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Additional evidence**: While the model includes reference PMIDs for each annotation, additional mechanistic details from the papers would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarification of mechanism**: The model could be enhanced by specifying the exact mechanism of how SUMOylation of DDX39A alters its RNA binding properties. The model uses \"directly negatively regulates\" but this could be further clarified with mRNA targets specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Connection to downstream effects**: The model shows DDX39A providing input for MAVS, TRAF3, and TRAF6 activities, but doesn't show how these components further affect innate immune responses. Extending the model to include downstream effects on type I IFN production would make the biological significance clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model adequately represents the pathway by which DDX39A, when SUMOylated by RANBP2, regulates the export of immune-related transcripts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The model follows GO-CAM best practices and accurately captures the biological knowledge from the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model effectively depicts how DDX39A functions as a negative regulator of innate immune responses by controlling the nuclear export of mRNAs encoding immune signaling components (TRAF3, TRAF6, and MAVS), and how this function is regulated by RANBP2-mediated SUMOylation.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model titled \"Signaling by Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/VIP mediated by VIPR1 receptor (Human)\" represents a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway in humans. The model depicts how VIP (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide) binds to and activates the VIPR1 receptor, leading to G protein (GNAS) activation, which then activates adenylate cyclase (ADCY6), resulting in the production of cAMP.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Components\n",
      "\n",
      "The model consists of four main activities:\n",
      "1. VIP (P01282) with neuropeptide hormone activity (GO:0005184)\n",
      "2. VIPR1 receptor (P32241) with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor activity (GO:0004999)\n",
      "3. GNAS (Q5JWF2) with G protein activity (GO:0003925)\n",
      "4. ADCY6 (O43306) with adenylate cyclase activity (GO:0004016)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Appropriate cellular locations**: The model correctly represents the cellular locations of each component. VIP is located in the extracellular space (GO:0005615), VIPR1 is in the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), GNAS is in the cytosol (GO:0005829), and ADCY6 properly functions at the membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correct biological process**: All activities are appropriately part of the adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway (GO:0007189).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct causal connections**: The model properly shows the causal flow:\n",
      "   - VIP directly positively regulates VIPR1 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "   - VIPR1 directly positively regulates GNAS (RO:0002629)\n",
      "   - GNAS directly positively regulates ADCY6 (RO:0002629)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Correct molecular output**: The model correctly shows that ADCY6 produces cAMP (CHEBI:17489)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Appropriate evidence**: Each activity and causal connection includes evidence codes and PMID references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Minor Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Gβγ subunits**: While the model correctly shows GNAS (Gα subunit) activation, it doesn't represent the Gβ and Gγ subunits that form the complete heterotrimeric G protein complex. According to the paper PMID:17110384, ADCY6 interacts with GNB1 and GNG2 (Gβ and Gγ subunits). However, the omission is reasonable as GNAS is the primary activator of ADCY6.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Simplified mechanism**: The model doesn't represent some details of the activation mechanism, such as the specific conformational changes that occur when VIP binds to VIPR1 or when GNAS activates ADCY6. However, this level of detail is not typically required in GO-CAM models.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Consistency with Literature\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by the literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The UniProt entries for VIP (P01282), VIPR1 (P32241), GNAS (Q5JWF2), and ADCY6 (O43306) confirm the functions and interactions depicted in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. PMID:36385145 provides detailed structural information about VIP binding to VIPR1 and confirms the direct activation mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. PMID:17110384 and PMID:17916776 provide evidence for GNAS activation of ADCY6 and its role in producing cAMP.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. PMID:3456568 supports the function of VIP as a neuropeptide hormone.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. From PMID:36385145, we know that \"VIP is a neuropeptide involved in a diverse array of physiological processes through activating the PACAP subfamily of class B1 G protein-coupled receptors: VIP receptor 1 (VPR1) and VIP receptor 2 (VPR2).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the VIP-VIPR1-GNAS-ADCY6 signaling pathway. It follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular activities, their locations, and causal relationships. The model is well-supported by the literature and provides a clear, concise representation of this important signaling pathway.\n",

      "3. The production of cAMP as the key second messenger output\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "**Title:** Signaling by PACAP/ADCYAP1 mediated by VIPR1 receptor (Human)  \n",
      "**Taxon:** Human (NCBITaxon:9606)  \n",
      "**Status:** Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Components\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents the signaling pathway where the neuropeptide PACAP/ADCYAP1 (Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide) activates VIPR1 receptors (Vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1), leading to G protein activation and subsequent adenylate cyclase activity, resulting in cAMP production.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model contains four key activities:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ADCYAP1 (P18509)** - Functions as a neuropeptide hormone (GO:0005184) in the extracellular space\n",
      "2. **VIPR1 (P32241)** - Acts as a PACAP receptor (GO:0001634) in the plasma membrane\n",
      "3. **GNAS (Q5JWF2)** - Performs G protein activity (GO:0003925) in the cytosol\n",
      "4. **ADCY6 (O43306)** - Exhibits adenylate cyclase activity (GO:0004016) producing cAMP\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Logic and Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the following signaling cascade:\n",
      "- ADCYAP1 (PACAP) binding to VIPR1 receptor (directly positively regulates)\n",
      "- VIPR1 activation of the G protein GNAS (directly positively regulates)\n",
      "- GNAS activation of adenylate cyclase ADCY6 (directly positively regulates)\n",
      "- ADCY6 producing cAMP (has output CHEBI:17489)\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are part of the adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway (GO:0007189), which is appropriate for this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Quality\n",
      "The model includes high-quality evidence for each activity:\n",
      "- All assertions use direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314)\n",
      "- Evidence is supported by appropriate literature references (PMID:36385145, PMID:17110384, PMID:17916776, etc.)\n",
      "- All activities have proper contributor information and recent dates (2024-09-17)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate Molecular Representation:** The model correctly captures the GPCR signaling cascade from ligand binding through G protein activation to second messenger production.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Cellular Localization:** Each component is correctly localized to its appropriate cellular compartment (extracellular space for PACAP, plasma membrane for VIPR1, cytosol for GNAS).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Strong Evidence Base:** The model is well-supported by recent scientific literature, particularly PMID:36385145, which provides detailed structural information on VPAC receptor family peptide binding and selectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistent with Current Knowledge:** The model accurately represents the known signaling pathway for PACAP activating VIPR1 receptors, leading to G protein (Gs) activation and adenylate cyclase stimulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Improvement Opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consideration of Multiple AC Isoforms:** Based on PMID:23842570, there appears to be specificity in which adenylate cyclase isoforms are activated. The model currently only includes ADCY6, but the literature suggests that multiple AC isoforms may be involved in PACAP-VIPR1 signaling. Consider adding a note about potential involvement of other AC isoforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Downstream Signaling:** The model currently ends at cAMP production. Consider extending the model to include downstream effects of cAMP production, such as PKA activation, which would provide a more complete representation of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Receptor Selectivity:** PMID:36385145 discusses the selectivity of PACAP for different receptor types (VPAC1R vs PAC1R). The model could potentially note that PACAP can also activate other receptor types (particularly PAC1R) with different affinities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **G Protein Subunit Specification:** The model correctly shows GNAS (Gαs) but could potentially include information about the βγ subunits, which according to PMID:17110384 also play a role in adenylate cyclase regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM annotation guidelines for signaling receptor activity:\n",
      "- ADCYAP1 correctly enables neuropeptide hormone activity (GO:0005184)\n",
      "- VIPR1 correctly enables PACAP receptor activity (GO:0001634)\n",
      "- The causal relations use appropriate predicates (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates)\n",
      "- Cellular locations are appropriate for each component\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the \"Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines,\" this model correctly represents a protein ligand-activated signaling receptor pathway.\n",

      "Overall, this GO-CAM model (gomodel:66e382fb00000408) is a high-quality representation of PACAP signaling through VIPR1 receptors leading to adenylate cyclase activation and cAMP production. The model is well-supported by scientific evidence, follows GO-CAM annotation guidelines, and accurately represents the known biology of this signaling pathway.\n",

      "**Title**: BMP8A role in spermatogenesis via SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD9 (Human)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Taxon**: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Status**: Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Architecture Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the BMP signaling pathway focusing on BMP8A's role in spermatogenesis, specifically how BMP8A activates its receptors and downstream SMAD signaling. The model includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. BMP8A (UniProtKB:Q7Z5Y6) with cytokine activity\n",
      "2. BMP receptors (BMPR2 and BMPR1A)\n",
      "3. Downstream SMAD transcription factors (SMAD1, SMAD5, SMAD9)\n",
      "4. Appropriate causal connections between these components\n",
      "5. Cellular locations for each activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strong Points\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate biological pathway representation**: The model correctly depicts the canonical BMP signaling pathway where:\n",
      "   - BMP8A has cytokine activity in the extracellular space\n",
      "   - BMPR2 acts as the type II receptor\n",
      "   - BMPR1A functions as the type I receptor\n",
      "   - SMAD1/5/9 are activated by BMPR1A phosphorylation and translocate to the nucleus\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-supported evidence**: The model uses appropriate evidence codes and citations, including:\n",
      "   - Direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) from primary literature sources\n",
      "   - Mutant phenotype evidence (ECO:0000315)\n",
      "   - Appropriate localization of activities in relevant cellular compartments\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal relationships**: The model properly represents the causal cascade using the recommended relationships:\n",
      "   - BMP8A directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) BMPR2\n",
      "   - BMPR2 directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) BMPR1A\n",
      "   - BMPR1A directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) SMAD1/5/9\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Molecular Function Details**: The model appropriately assigns molecular functions to each protein:\n",
      "   - BMP8A: cytokine activity (GO:0005125)\n",
      "   - BMPR2: activin receptor activity, type II (GO:0016362)\n",
      "   - BMPR1A: transforming growth factor beta receptor activity, type I (GO:0005025)\n",
      "   - SMAD1/5/9: DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific (GO:0000981)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cellular Compartmentalization**: Each protein activity is correctly placed in its cellular compartment:\n",
      "   - BMP8A in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "   - Receptors at plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - SMAD proteins in nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Receptor Complex Representation**: \n",
      "   - The model separately represents BMPR1A and BMPR2, which is technically correct, but it might be worth considering representing the active receptor complex in line with how BMP receptors function. According to the complexes guidance document, since the individual subunits have known activities, the current approach is acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **SMAD Nuclear Translocation**: \n",
      "   - While the model places SMAD1/5/9 activities in the nucleus, it could more explicitly represent how phosphorylation by BMPR1A leads to their nuclear translocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **SMAD Oligomerization**: \n",
      "   - The model doesn't capture the formation of SMAD complexes (with SMAD4/co-SMAD), which is an important step in the canonical BMP signaling pathway. Based on the literature (Kretzschmar et al., 1997), SMAD phosphorylation by the type I receptor leads to association with SMAD4/DPC4 and nuclear accumulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Downstream Targets**: \n",
      "   - The model focuses on the core signaling pathway but doesn't include the downstream targets of SMAD transcriptional activity relevant to spermatogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Biological Process Context**: \n",
      "   - While the model's title mentions spermatogenesis, there could be more specific annotation to relate the activities to specific processes in spermatogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Validity\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is scientifically valid and well-supported by the literature. The BMP8A signaling through BMPR2/BMPR1A to activate SMAD1/5/9 is consistent with what is known about BMP signaling pathways. Based on the UniProt entry for BMP8A (Q7Z5Y6), it plays a role in spermatogenesis and initiates the canonical BMP signaling cascade by associating with type I receptor BMPR1A and type II receptor BMPR2. The primary literature evidence (PMID:9136927) clearly supports the phosphorylation of SMAD1 by BMP type I receptors and the resulting nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consider adding SMAD4**: The model could be enhanced by including SMAD4/DPC4, which forms complexes with phosphorylated SMAD1/5/9 as demonstrated in the Kretzschmar paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include specific spermatogenesis-related processes**: Add specific biological processes related to spermatogenesis that are regulated by this pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add Id1/Id2 target genes**: The PMID:15657086 and PMID:17992660 papers discuss downstream targets of BMP signaling such as Id1 and Id2, which could be added to make the model more comprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider adding negative regulators**: The pathway is also regulated by negative regulators like Smurf1 and noggin, which could be included to provide a more complete picture of BMP signaling regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model effectively represents the core BMP8A signaling pathway through its receptors to SMAD transcription factors. It follows GO-CAM best practices regarding the representation of activities, causal relationships, and cellular locations. The model is well-supported by literature evidence and provides a solid representation of this important developmental signaling pathway. With the suggested enhancements, it could provide an even more comprehensive view of BMP8A's role in spermatogenesis.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the molecular mechanisms by which BMP8B (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 8B) inhibits adipocyte differentiation in humans. The model captures a signaling cascade from the extracellular BMP8B protein through the ACVR1B receptor to SMAD2 and SMAD3 transcription factors, which ultimately leads to the negative regulation of cell differentiation.\n",

      "   - Located in nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "   - Part of negative regulation of cell differentiation (GO:0045596)\n",

      "   - Located in nucleus (GO:0005634)\n",
      "   - Part of negative regulation of cell differentiation (GO:0045596)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Causal Flow\n",
      "The model represents a clear causal flow from extracellular signaling to transcriptional regulation:\n",
      "1. BMP8B in the extracellular space provides input for ACVR1B receptor at the plasma membrane\n",
      "2. ACVR1B directly positively regulates SMAD2 and SMAD3 \n",
      "3. SMAD2 and SMAD3 function as transcriptional activators in the nucleus\n",
      "4. All components are part of the negative regulation of cell differentiation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Literature Support\n",
      "The model is supported by several publications cited in the annotations:\n",
      "- PMID:24378993 supports the role of SMAD3 as a DNA-binding transcription activator \n",
      "- PMID:9892009 supports ACVR1B's direct positive regulation of SMAD2 and SMAD3\n",
      "- PMID:9032295 supports ACVR1B localization in the plasma membrane\n",
      "- PMID:21145499 supports SMAD2 nuclear localization\n",
      "\n",
      "### QC Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Biological Accuracy**: The model correctly represents the established pathway by which BMP signaling through ACVR1B leads to SMAD2/3 activation and nuclear localization to regulate transcription.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Correct GO Terms**: The molecular functions (cytokine activity, receptor activity, transcription activator activity) are appropriately chosen for each protein.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate Causal Relations**: The causal relations (RO:0002409 for \"provides input for\" and RO:0002629 for \"directly positively regulates\") accurately depict the flow of information through this signaling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Subcellular Localization**: The model correctly annotates proteins with their proper cellular compartments (extracellular for BMP8B, plasma membrane for ACVR1B, and nucleus for SMAD2/3).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence Support**: Each assertion is backed by appropriate literature evidence with relevant PMIDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Adipocyte Context**: While the title specifies \"BMP8B role in adipocyte differentiation inhibition,\" there is no explicit annotation to XAO:0006041 (adipocyte) in the activity components, despite it being listed in the objects. This cellular context should be included to better align with the model's title.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mechanistic Detail**: The model doesn't capture the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 by ACVR1B, which is a critical mechanistic detail of this pathway. Based on PMID:9892009, ACVR1B phosphorylates SMAD2/3 to enable their nuclear translocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **SMAD Complex Formation**: While individual SMAD proteins are represented, the formation of SMAD2/3-SMAD4 complexes, which is essential for their transcriptional activity, is not included. According to the literature (PMID:21145499), activated SMADs form complexes that regulate transcription.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Downstream Target Genes**: The model doesn't include specific target genes whose expression is regulated by SMAD2/3 to inhibit adipocyte differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Completeness of Pathway**: BMP8B is shown interacting directly with ACVR1B, but BMPs typically require both Type I and Type II receptors for signaling. The model doesn't include a Type II receptor component.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Adipocyte Context**: Include the adipocyte term (XAO:0006041) as the \"occurs_in\" location for relevant activities to make the cellular context explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include SMAD4**: Add SMAD4 and represent the formation of SMAD complexes, which are crucial for transcriptional regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add Phosphorylation Mechanism**: Include annotations that capture the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 by ACVR1B.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Include Type II Receptor**: BMP signaling typically requires both Type I and Type II receptors. Consider adding a Type II BMP receptor to complete the receptor complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add Target Genes**: If known, include specific target genes regulated by SMAD2/3 that affect adipocyte differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "This GO-CAM model accurately represents the core signaling cascade through which BMP8B inhibits adipocyte differentiation via ACVR1B and SMAD2/3 activation. While the fundamental pathway is correct, additional molecular details would strengthen the model's biological completeness. The model aligns with current literature on BMP signaling through SMAD transcription factors and provides a valuable resource for understanding BMP8B's role in the negative regulation of cell differentiation.\n",

      "# GO-CAM Review: Signaling by Secretin/SCT mediated by SCTR receptor (Human) [gomodel:66e382fb00002293](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:66e382fb00002293)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the signaling pathway initiated by the binding of secretin (SCT) to its receptor (SCTR), leading to G protein activation, adenylyl cyclase stimulation, and cAMP production in human cells. The model captures a canonical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway with appropriate molecular activities, cellular locations, and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Adherence to GO-CAM Structure**: The model appropriately represents a complete signaling pathway from ligand binding through second messenger production.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Molecular Functions**: \n",
      "   - SCT has hormone activity (GO:0005179)\n",
      "   - SCTR has secretin receptor activity (GO:0015055)\n",
      "   - GNAS has G protein activity (GO:0003925)\n",
      "   - ADCY6 has adenylate cyclase activity (GO:0004016)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct Cellular Locations**:\n",
      "   - SCT is correctly located in extracellular space (GO:0005615)\n",
      "   - SCTR is correctly located in plasma membrane (GO:0005886)\n",
      "   - GNAS is correctly located in cytosol (GO:0005829)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Accurate Biological Process**: All activities are part of the adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway (GO:0007189).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complete Causal Chain**: The model includes appropriate causal relationships using \"directly positively regulates\" (RO:0002629) between activities:\n",
      "   - SCT hormone activity → SCTR receptor activity\n",
      "   - SCTR receptor activity → GNAS G protein activity\n",
      "   - GNAS G protein activity → ADCY6 adenylate cyclase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Appropriate Output**: ADCY6 adenylate cyclase activity has the output of 3',5'-cyclic AMP (CHEBI:17489).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evidence Quality**: The model uses a mix of evidence types:\n",
      "   - Direct assay evidence (ECO:0000314) for most critical relationships\n",
      "   - Sequence similarity evidence (ECO:0000250) for some aspects of SCT and SCTR\n",
      "   \n",
      "   This is appropriate, but it would be beneficial to ensure the most direct experimental evidence is used when available.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Model Completeness**: The model could potentially be expanded to include:\n",
      "   - Downstream effects of cAMP production (e.g., PKA activation)\n",
      "   - Additional regulatory relationships that may modulate the pathway\n",
      "   - Potential cross-talk with other signaling pathways\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **GNAS Representation**: The model uses UniProtKB:Q5JWF2 (GNAS1_HUMAN) for the G protein alpha subunit, which represents the XLas isoform. While this is technically correct as it can couple to SCTR, the more commonly referenced isoform in GPCR signaling literature is P63092 (GNAS2). Both are functional, so this is not incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Secretin Function**: The model correctly represents secretin's role as a hormone that binds to the secretin receptor. According to UniProt data, secretin (SCT) is involved in regulating pH of duodenal content, food intake, and water homeostasis, which aligns with the signaling pathway represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Receptor-G Protein Coupling**: SCTR is appropriately shown to couple to Gs (GNAS), which is consistent with literature showing that secretin receptor activates adenylyl cyclase through Gs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Downstream Signaling**: The production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase 6 (ADCY6) as a result of G protein activation is biologically accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signaling Receptor Guidelines**: The model follows the guidelines for signaling receptor activity annotation by:\n",
      "   - Correctly representing the hormone (ligand) activity with its \"directly positively regulates\" relationship to the receptor\n",
      "   - Properly locating the hormone in extracellular space and the receptor in plasma membrane\n",
      "   - Situating all activities within the appropriate biological process\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex Annotation**: The model appropriately annotates individual proteins rather than complexes, which is the recommended approach when the specific protein carrying the activity is known.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Causal Relations**: The model correctly uses \"directly positively regulates\" for the causal chain, which is appropriate for these direct molecular interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Signaling by Secretin/SCT mediated by SCTR receptor (Human)\" is a well-constructed representation of the secretin signaling pathway. It follows GO-CAM best practices for signaling pathway annotation and accurately represents the biological process with appropriate molecular functions, cellular locations, and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the key molecular steps in secretin signaling from hormone-receptor binding through G protein activation to adenylyl cyclase stimulation and cAMP production. The evidence used to support the model is appropriate, with direct experimental evidence cited for most key relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "This model provides a valuable resource for understanding secretin signaling and serves as a good template for other GPCR signaling pathways.\n",

      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: \"TRAF6 and HUWE1 catalyze branched-linked polyubiquitination that promote NF-kappa-B signaling (Human).\"  \n",
      "Taxon: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)  \n",
      "Status: production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Content and Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "This model represents a pathway involving branched-linked polyubiquitination that promotes NF-kappa-B signaling, with a focus on the roles of TRAF6 and HUWE1. The model consists of 8 activities that are causally connected to represent signaling events.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Main Components\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CYLD** (Q9NQC7) - K63-linked deubiquitinase activity\n",
      "2. **TAB2** (Q9NYJ8) - K63-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding\n",
      "3. **MAP3K7/TAK1** (O43318) - protein serine/threonine kinase activity\n",
      "4. **IKBKB** (O14920) - IkappaB kinase activity\n",
      "5. **NFKBIA/IκBα** (P25963) - protein sequestering activity\n",
      "6. **RELA/p65** (Q04206) & **NFKB1/p50** (P19838) - DNA-binding transcription factor activity\n",
      "7. **TRAF6** (Q9Y4K3) - ubiquitin-ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "8. **HUWE1** (Q7Z6Z7) - ubiquitin protein ligase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pathway Logic Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The model depicts the following pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. TRAF6 catalyzes K63-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070534)\n",
      "2. HUWE1 adds K48-linked ubiquitin branches to TRAF6-created K63-linked chains (GO:0070936)\n",
      "3. These branched chains are recognized by TAB2 (K63-linked polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding)\n",
      "4. This activates MAP3K7/TAK1 (protein serine/threonine kinase activity)\n",
      "5. MAP3K7 activates IKBKB (IkappaB kinase activity)\n",
      "6. IKBKB leads to inactivation of NFKBIA (protein sequestering activity)\n",
      "7. This relieves inhibition of NF-kappa-B transcription factors RELA and NFKB1\n",
      "8. CYLD acts as a negative regulator by deubiquitinating K63-linked chains\n",
      "\n",
      "The model properly shows that CYLD deubiquitinase (GO:0061578) negatively regulates NF-kappa-B signaling (GO:0043124) through removal of K63-linked ubiquitin chains, but the branched K48/K63 ubiquitin chains created by TRAF6 and HUWE1 are protected from CYLD's activity, allowing signaling to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evaluation of Model Quality\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accurate molecular mechanisms**: The model correctly represents the branched-linked polyubiquitination mechanism as described in the literature (Ohtake et al., 2016, Mol Cell).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper causal relationships**: The causal relationships are represented appropriately with the correct predicates:\n",
      "   - \"RO:0002413\" (provides input for) between TRAF6 and HUWE1\n",
      "   - \"RO:0012010\" (ubiquitinates) between HUWE1 and CYLD\n",
      "   - \"RO:0012010\" (ubiquitinates) between HUWE1 and TAB2\n",
      "   - \"RO:0002629\" (directly positively regulates) between TAB2 and MAP3K7\n",
      "   - \"RO:0002629\" (directly positively regulates) between MAP3K7 and IKBKB\n",
      "   - \"RO:0002409\" (indirectly upstream of, positive effect) between IKBKB and NFKBIA\n",
      "   - \"RO:0002630\" (directly negatively regulates) between NFKBIA and transcription factors\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Appropriate BP annotations**: Each activity is properly annotated with the relevant biological process:\n",
      "   - TRAF6: protein K63-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070534)\n",
      "   - HUWE1: protein K48-linked ubiquitination (GO:0070936)\n",
      "   - CYLD: negative regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0043124)\n",
      "   - TAB2, MAP3K7, IKBKB: positive regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0043123)\n",
      "   - NFKBIA: negative regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0043124)\n",
      "   - RELA and NFKB1: canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction (GO:0007249)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evidence**: Each activity and causal relationship is supported by evidence with appropriate ECO codes and literature references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing participants**: While the model represents the core pathway accurately, it doesn't include upstream activators like cytokine receptors or TLR signaling that would initiate the TRAF6 activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Subcellular location**: Only NFKBIA, RELA, and NFKB1 have subcellular location annotations (chromatin for RELA/NFKB1, cytoplasm for IKBKB). Adding subcellular location information for other proteins would enhance the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing IKK complex components**: The model only includes IKBKB, but the IKK complex typically consists of IKBKA, IKBKB, and IKBKG/NEMO. Including these additional components would make the model more complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Missing feedback mechanisms**: NF-kappa-B signaling often involves feedback mechanisms, such as NF-kappa-B-dependent transcription of inhibitors like NFKBIA, which are not represented in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices as outlined in the available documentation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **E3 ubiquitin ligase annotation**: Both TRAF6 and HUWE1 are properly annotated with the correct molecular functions and biological processes as per the \"E3 ubiquitin ligases\" guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causal relationships**: The causal relationships follow the recommended predicates for different types of regulatory relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence codes**: Appropriate evidence codes (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) are used throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions for Enhancement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Include upstream activators**: Add the initiating events, such as cytokine receptor activation or TLR signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add subcellular locations**: Annotate all activities with their appropriate subcellular locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Include IKK complex components**: Add IKBKA and IKBKG/NEMO to represent the complete IKK complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Represent feedback mechanisms**: Include the feedback regulation of NF-kappa-B signaling, such as the transcriptional activation of inhibitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Include substrates or targets**: For key enzymes like TRAF6, HUWE1, CYLD, and IKBKB, consider annotating specific substrates where known.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model (gomodel:66f5faaa00000112) accurately represents the mechanism of branched-linked polyubiquitination in NF-kappa-B signaling mediated by TRAF6 and HUWE1, with negative regulation by CYLD. The model follows GO-CAM best practices and includes appropriate causal relationships and evidence. While there are areas for potential enhancement, the core biological pathway is well-captured and the model provides a valuable representation of this important signaling mechanism.\n",

      "## Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents retinoid (vitamin A) metabolic processes in mouse. It includes key enzymes involved in retinoid transport, binding, metabolism, and storage. The model captures the flow of retinol metabolism through various activities including hydrolysis, transport, oxidation, and esterification within the retinoid metabolic pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The model correctly represents \"retinoid metabolic process\" (GO:0001523) as the overarching biological process, with individual molecular activities properly identified as part of this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The causal connections between activities use appropriate predicates, generally following the flow of the retinoid metabolic pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Molecular function assignments are well-supported by literature evidence (ECO codes are appropriate and include references to primary literature).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The model correctly represents cellular localization of different activities (e.g., extracellular region, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum membrane, cytosol).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Chemical entities (CHEBI terms) are appropriately used to represent the molecular inputs and outputs of the different enzymatic reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Complex Annotation\n",
      "The model includes GO:0042627 (chylomicron) as a protein complex enabling the retinoid binding activity (GO:0005501), but no members of this complex are specified:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "\"id\":\"gomodel:66f5faaa00001204/66f5faaa00001265\",\n",
      "\"enabled_by\":{\"type\":\"EnabledByProteinComplexAssociation\",\"term\":\"GO:0042627\",\"members\":[]}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "According to \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM,\" when a complex is used, it should either include the subunits that carry the activity (if known) or use the GO complex term if the specific protein carrying the activity is not known. In this case, the specific proteins in the chylomicron that bind retinoids should be specified if known, or a note should be included explaining why the complex is used without specified members.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Molecular Carrier Activity\n",
      "The model correctly uses molecular carrier activity (GO:0140104) for Rbp2 (MGI:MGI:97877), but this should be carefully reviewed to ensure it follows the guidelines for molecular carrier activity:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The model correctly uses \"has_primary_input\" to indicate all-trans-retinol (CHEBI:17336), but it's not clear if appropriate downstream connections are made to show where the carried molecule is delivered.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Completeness of Evidence\n",
      "Some activities lack evidence codes or citations:\n",
      "- The chylomicron retinoid binding activity (gomodel:66f5faaa00001204/66f5faaa00001265) lacks evidence annotations.\n",
      "- Several causal associations lack evidence codes.\n",
      "\n",

      "Overall, this GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the retinoid metabolic process in mouse. It captures the key activities and relationships in the pathway, with strong evidence support. The model would benefit from a few clarifications around complex representation and the addition of evidence codes for all assertions. The biological content is accurate and consistent with the literature. The connections between activities represent the known flow of the retinoid metabolic pathway reasonably well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is parsimonious and focused on the core aspects of retinoid metabolism, making it accessible and understandable while still being comprehensive. With the minor improvements suggested, this would be an excellent curated model of retinoid metabolism.\n",

      "### Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:67086be200000363](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:67086be200000363)) represents the cardiolipin biosynthetic pathway in fission yeast (*Schizosaccharomyces pombe*). The model details the enzymatic steps involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin, a unique phospholipid found in mitochondrial membranes that is essential for mitochondrial function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Content and Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes four key activities connected in a causal pathway:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase activity** (GO:0004605)\n",
      "   - Enabled by: PomBase:SPBC1A4.06c (tam41)\n",
      "   - Occurs in: Mitochondrial matrix (GO:0005759)\n",
      "   - Part of: CDP-diacylglycerol biosynthetic process (GO:0016024)\n",

      "   - Part of: Cardiolipin biosynthetic process (GO:0032049)\n",
      "   - Has input: CDP-diacylglycerol (CHEBI:17962)\n",
      "   - Causally upstream of: Phosphatidylglycerophosphatase activity\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Phosphatidylglycerophosphatase activity** (GO:0008962)\n",

      "   - Has output: Cardiolipin(2-) (CHEBI:62237)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is well-supported by evidence:\n",
      "- Most activities are backed by direct experimental evidence (ECO:0000314) or sequence orthology evidence (ECO:0000266)\n",
      "- Key evidential support comes from PMID:31178220, PMID:9468529, and PMID:29958934\n",
      "- From the literature (PMID:29958934) I was able to verify that SPAC22A12.08c indeed encodes the cardiolipin synthase in S. pombe, confirming a key element of the model\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation of Causal Connections\n",
      "\n",
      "The causal flow is well-represented:\n",
      "- All activities are appropriately connected using the \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) predicate\n",
      "- The connections accurately represent the sequential enzymatic steps in cardiolipin biosynthesis\n",
      "- The inputs and outputs of reactions (specifically CDP-diacylglycerol and cardiolipin) are properly annotated\n",
      "\n",
      "### Anatomical Context\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly localizes:\n",
      "- Most activities to the mitochondrial matrix (GO:0005759)\n",
      "- The final cardiolipin synthase activity to the mitochondrial membrane (GO:0031966)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is consistent with the known localization of cardiolipin biosynthesis enzymes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues Identified\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Minor redundancy issue**: There is a duplicate \"has_input\" association for CHEBI:17962 (CDP-diacylglycerol) in the PomBase:SPBP18G5.02 activity node. One of these inputs lacks evidence information.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing intermediate molecule**: The model doesn't explicitly represent phosphatidylglycerol as an output of the phosphatidylglycerophosphatase activity and input to the cardiolipin synthase activity. This intermediate molecule should be included for complete pathway representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence consistency**: There's inconsistent evidence attribution for some of the connections. For example, one of the \"has_input\" connections for CDP-diacylglycerol has no evidence indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Remove redundant input**: Remove the duplicate input annotation for CDP-diacylglycerol or add appropriate evidence information.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add missing intermediate molecule**: Add phosphatidylglycerol (PG) as:\n",
      "   - An output of the phosphatidylglycerophosphatase activity (PomBase:SPCC645.02)\n",
      "   - An input to the cardiolipin synthase activity (PomBase:SPAC22A12.08c)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ensure complete evidence**: Add evidence information to all associations, particularly the missing evidence for one of the CDP-diacylglycerol inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is generally well-constructed and accurately represents the cardiolipin biosynthetic pathway in S. pombe with good evidence support. It correctly identifies the key enzymatic steps, their causal relationships, and subcellular localization. The minor issues identified don't significantly affect the biological accuracy of the model but addressing them would improve its completeness and consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flow of the pathway is logical and follows the established understanding of cardiolipin biosynthesis, starting with the conversion of phosphatidic acid to CDP-diacylglycerol, then to phosphatidylglycerol phosphate, phosphatidylglycerol, and finally to cardiolipin. The evidence from published literature supports this representation.\n",

      "# GO-CAM Model Review: gomodel:67086be200001578\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This model, titled \"Negative regulation of BNIP3 and BNIP3L via PPTC7 and FBXL4 (Human)\", represents a biological pathway that negatively regulates mitophagy through the controlled degradation of the mitophagy receptors BNIP3 and BNIP3L/NIX via the PPTC7-FBXL4-RBX1 axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scientific Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents a recently discovered mechanism described in PMID:38992176, where PPTC7 acts as a molecular adaptor between the mitophagy receptors BNIP3/NIX and the SCFFBXL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of these receptors, thereby suppressing mitophagy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key molecular interactions represented in the model are:\n",
      "1. PPTC7 (Q8NI37) functioning as a protein-macromolecule adaptor (GO:0030674)\n",
      "2. FBXL4 (Q9UKA2) serving as a ubiquitin ligase-substrate adaptor (GO:1990756)\n",
      "3. RBX1 (P62877) acting as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (GO:0061630)\n",
      "4. BNIP3 (Q12983) functioning as a mitochondrion autophagosome adaptor (GO:0140580)\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these activities are correctly located at the mitochondrial outer membrane (GO:0005741), consistent with the published literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure and Connections\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly depicts the flow of activities using appropriate causal connections:\n",
      "1. PPTC7's adaptor activity provides input for (RO:0002413) FBXL4's adaptor activity\n",
      "2. FBXL4's adaptor activity provides input for (RO:0002413) RBX1's ubiquitin ligase activity\n",
      "3. RBX1's ubiquitin ligase activity directly negatively regulates (RO:0002630) BNIP3's mitophagy receptor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "This structure accurately reflects the mechanism where PPTC7 facilitates the recognition of BNIP3/NIX by FBXL4, leading to their ubiquitination by the SCF complex and subsequent degradation, thereby inhibiting mitophagy.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Evidence Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The model appropriately cites the primary research article (PMID:38992176) for most of the assertions, using the correct evidence code ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion). A secondary citation (PMID:22505714) supports BNIP3's role in mitophagy with appropriate evidence code ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conformance to GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing molecular adaptors and E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Molecular Adaptor Representation**: PPTC7 is correctly annotated with \"protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\" (GO:0030674), which aligns with the guidelines in the \"Molecular_adaptor_activity\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Representation**: The model correctly depicts the SCF complex components:\n",
      "   - FBXL4 as the substrate adaptor with \"ubiquitin ligase-substrate adaptor activity\" (GO:1990756)\n",
      "   - RBX1 with \"ubiquitin protein ligase activity\" (GO:0061630)\n",
      "   \n",
      "   This follows the pattern described in the \"E3_ubiquitin_ligases\" document for \"When only substrate adaptor and substrate are known.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Part_of Relationships**: All activities are appropriately indicated as being \"part_of\" the biological process \"negative regulation of mitophagy\" (GO:1901525).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Occurs_in Relationships**: The cellular location is correctly specified for each activity, with PPTC7, FBXL4, and BNIP3 activities occurring in the mitochondrial outer membrane (GO:0005741) and RBX1's activity in the cytoplasm (GO:0005737).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Causal Relationships**: The model uses appropriate causal relationships between activities:\n",
      "   - \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) between adaptor activities\n",
      "   - \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630) for the effect on BNIP3/NIX\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is largely accurate and follows GO-CAM best practices, there are a few potential improvements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Component**: The model doesn't explicitly include other components of the SCF complex such as SKP1 and CUL1. According to the E3 ubiquitin ligases guidelines, these could be included for a more complete representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **BNIP3L/NIX Representation**: Although the model title mentions both BNIP3 and BNIP3L/NIX, only BNIP3 is explicitly represented in the model. Since both proteins are regulated in the same manner according to PMID:38992176, BNIP3L/NIX (UniProtKB:O60238) could be added with the same relationships and activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Evidence**: While most assertions have appropriate evidence, there is a second causal association between RBX1 and BNIP3 that lacks evidence codes. This should be remedied by adding the appropriate evidence codes and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "The model faithfully represents the current understanding of this pathway as described in the primary literature. The discovery that PPTC7 acts as an adaptor between BNIP3/NIX and the SCFFBXL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is a recent finding (PMID:38992176) and the model accurately captures this mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly indicates that this process occurs at the mitochondrial outer membrane and ultimately leads to the negative regulation of mitophagy, which aligns with the biological understanding presented in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Negative regulation of BNIP3 and BNIP3L via PPTC7 and FBXL4 (Human)\" is a high-quality representation of the recently discovered pathway regulating mitophagy. It follows GO-CAM best practices and accurately represents the biological mechanism with appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suggested improvements would enhance the model's completeness but do not detract from its current accuracy. The model provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of mitophagy regulation and would be useful for researchers in this field.\n",

      "**Taxon:** Human (NCBITaxon:9606)  \n",
      "**Status:** Production\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This model describes the molecular functions and interactions involved in sperm-egg recognition during fertilization in humans. The model involves four key proteins:\n",
      "1. IZUMO1 (UniProtKB:Q8IYV9) - Sperm protein with receptor ligand activity\n",
      "2. IZUMO1R/JUNO (UniProtKB:A6ND01) - Egg protein with signaling receptor activity\n",
      "3. SPACA6 (UniProtKB:W5XKT8) - Sperm protein with protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\n",
      "4. TMEM81 (UniProtKB:Q6P7N7) - Sperm protein with protein-macromolecule adaptor activity\n",
      "\n",
      "All activities are part of the biological process of sperm-egg recognition (GO:0035036) and occur at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths of the Model\n",
      "1. **Recent Evidence Base**: The model is well-supported by a recent publication (PMID:39423812, 2024) that demonstrates the formation of a conserved fertilization complex involving IZUMO1, SPACA6, and TMEM81.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appropriate Molecular Functions**: The molecular functions assigned to each protein appear accurate:\n",
      "   - IZUMO1 as receptor ligand (GO:0048018)\n",
      "   - IZUMO1R/JUNO as signaling receptor (GO:0038023)\n",
      "   - SPACA6 and TMEM81 as protein-macromolecule adaptors (GO:0030674)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct Causal Relationships**: The model correctly shows SPACA6 and TMEM81 directly positively regulating (RO:0002629) IZUMO1's receptor ligand activity, followed by IZUMO1 directly positively regulating IZUMO1R/JUNO's signaling receptor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistent Cellular Location**: All activities appropriately occur at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex Representation**: Based on the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, since the model is representing a complex (IZUMO1, SPACA6, and TMEM81), it may be appropriate to consider if a GO complex ID could be used. However, since the individual roles of each protein are well-defined and supported by evidence, the current representation with individual proteins is also valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological Completeness**: While the model accurately represents the interaction between the sperm proteins and the egg receptor, it could be expanded to show the downstream effects following receptor activation. According to the UniProt entry for IZUMO1R/JUNO, the receptor is rapidly cleaved following fertilization to block polyspermy. This could be represented as a downstream event.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence Codes**: The model correctly uses ECO:0000250 (sequence similarity evidence) with references to mouse orthologs for some interactions, and ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) with the PMID reference for others. This is appropriate based on the available evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **MAIA/FCRL3 Consideration**: Recent evidence (PMID:36070373) suggests that in humans, FCRL3/MAIA replaces IZUMO1R/JUNO as the IZUMO1 receptor after initial sperm-egg adhesion. This subsequent interaction could potentially be included in an expanded version of the model to provide a more complete picture of the fertilization process in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model [gomodel:67086be200001601](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:67086be200001601) is well-constructed and accurately represents current knowledge about the sperm-egg recognition process during human fertilization. The model is appropriately parsimonious while capturing the key molecular functions and causal relationships involved in this process. It is supported by recent scientific evidence, particularly PMID:39423812, which provides direct experimental evidence for the interactions represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly applies GO-CAM best practices regarding the representation of complex interactions and is consistent with what is known about the proteins involved based on their UniProt entries. The causal relationships between the proteins accurately reflect the molecular mechanisms described in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this model is of high quality and provides a clear, evidence-supported representation of the sperm-egg recognition process in humans.\n",

      "   - Mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide synthesis\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-defined molecular functions**: Each activity has appropriately assigned molecular functions with proper evidence codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular localization**: Proper annotations for subcellular locations (primarily endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) are included.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Causal connections**: The model uses appropriate causal relationships (RO:0002413 \"provides input for\") to link activities in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Input/output annotations**: Chemical entities are properly linked as inputs and outputs of enzymatic activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complex representation**:\n",
      "   The model comment states: \"Orm1, Sac11 and Sac12 are part of the Serine palmitoyltransferase complex, function unknown\". However, these proteins are modeled individually without explicit representation of the complex. According to GO-CAM guidelines, if these form a functional complex but their specific activities are unknown, it might be better to use a GO complex ID to represent this. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Undefined molecular function**:\n",
      "   Several proteins (SPAC3C7.01c/sac12, SPBC119.09c/orm1, SPBC36B7.02/svf2) have \"GO:0003674\" (molecular_function) as their activity, indicating unknown molecular function. This is acceptable given evidence limitations, but when possible, specific functions should be determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence consistency**:\n",
      "   Most activities have appropriate evidence codes, but there are a few instances of empty evidence lists (e.g., in causal_associations for activities gomodel:67086be200002266/67086be200002288, gomodel:67086be200002266/67086be200002404). These should be completed with appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consistency in input/output**:\n",
      "   In some cases, like for activity gomodel:67086be200002266/67086be200002533 (SPAC17G8.11c/imt3), there are duplicate outputs (CHEBI:25168 mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide) and one output lacks evidence. This redundancy should be resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Potentially erroneous evidence**:\n",
      "   In gomodel:67086be200002266/67086be200002476 (SPBC36B7.02/svf2), there are evidence codes with \"with_objects\" references to \"PomBa\", \"PomBas\", and \"PomBase\" which appear to be incomplete or incorrect entries. These should be corrected to proper database references.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Protein without specific annotation**:\n",
      "   The model includes a generic protein (CHEBI:36080) with N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase activity (GO:0017040) but without evidence codes. This should be replaced with a specific protein if possible, or evidence should be added.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The causal flow is generally well-represented with appropriate use of RO:0002413 (provides input for) and RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The usage of evidence codes is generally appropriate, with many annotations supported by experimental evidence (ECO:0000269), sequence orthology (ECO:0000266), and biological aspect of ancestor evidence (ECO:0000318).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "The model accurately represents the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway according to current knowledge:\n",
      "- Initial synthesis of 3-ketosphinganine from serine and palmitoyl-CoA\n",
      "- Reduction to sphinganine\n",
      "- Conversion to ceramides\n",
      "- Further modification of ceramides with inositol phosphate\n",
      "- Mannosylation of inositol phosphoceramides\n",
      "\n",
      "The pathway flow is biologically consistent, and the localization of activities to appropriate subcellular compartments (ER and Golgi) matches known biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider using a GO complex term to represent the Serine palmitoyltransferase complex mentioned in the comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Complete the missing evidence annotations for causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Remove duplicate chemical entity listings and ensure all have appropriate evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Fix the incorrect evidence with_objects references (PomBa, PomBas).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Replace the generic protein (CHEBI:36080) with a specific protein if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Review and specify molecular functions for proteins currently annotated with GO:0003674 (molecular_function) if literature supports more specific activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality model that provides a comprehensive representation of sphingolipid biosynthesis in fission yeast, with only minor issues that should be addressed for completeness and consistency.\n",

      "### Model Overview\n",
      "This model represents retinoid metabolic processes in mouse, including various enzymatic activities and molecular functions involved in processing and transporting retinoids. The model includes 8 activities centered around the retinoid metabolic process (GO:0001523).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. **Appropriate biological process annotation**: All activities are correctly annotated as \"part of\" retinoid metabolic process (GO:0001523).\n",
      "2. **Evidence support**: Each activity has appropriate evidence codes with PMID references.\n",
      "3. **Causal connections**: The model appropriately uses RO:0002413 (provides input for) and RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) to connect related activities.\n",
      "4. **Cellular components**: Appropriate cellular locations are specified for most activities.\n",
      "5. **Use of molecular carrier activity**: Rbp2 (MGI:MGI:97877) is correctly annotated with molecular carrier activity (GO:0140104) following the guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues and Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing members in protein complex**:\n",
      "   - The chylomicron (GO:0042627) protein complex is annotated without any members. According to the complex annotation guidelines, either specific proteins should be included or a GO complex term should be used when the specific subunits are not known.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Add the specific protein members of the chylomicron complex if they are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incomplete input/output annotations**:\n",
      "   - Some activities are missing has_input/has_output annotations, making it difficult to track the flow of molecules through the pathway.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Add appropriate input/output annotations for each activity to fully specify the molecular conversions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular component annotations**:\n",
      "   - Activity gomodel:67086be200002592/67086be200002630 (Clps) is missing a cellular component annotation.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Add the appropriate cellular location for this activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Activity flow considerations**:\n",
      "   - While the model shows Rbp2 (molecular carrier) providing input for Lrat (phosphatidylcholine-retinol O-acyltransferase activity), additional connections between other activities could enhance the model's clarity.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Consider adding more causal connections between activities to better represent the complete pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complex model readability**:\n",

      "\n",
      "6. **Validation of enzymatic reactions**:\n",
      "   - Some enzymatic reactions like retinyl-palmitate esterase activity (GO:0050253) could benefit from additional literature validation.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Additional evidence references for key enzymatic steps would strengthen the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The GO-CAM model \"Retinoid Metabolic Process 3 (Mouse)\" is generally well-constructed and follows GO-CAM best practices. It effectively represents the flow of retinoid metabolism from molecular carrier activities through various enzymatic processes. With the minor improvements suggested above, particularly regarding the protein complex membership and complete input/output annotations, this model would provide an even clearer representation of retinoid metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model successfully captures the key players in retinoid metabolism and uses appropriate causal connections to show the relationships between different activities. It effectively demonstrates how GO-CAM can be used to model complex metabolic pathways.\n",

      "# Review of GO-CAM Model: gomodel:67086be200002705 \"Retinoid Metabolic Process 4 (Mouse)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "This model represents the retinoid metabolic process in mouse, focusing on the mechanisms by which retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives) are processed, transported, and metabolized. The model includes various proteins involved in this pathway, such as lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), retinol binding proteins (Rbp1, Rbp2), alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1), lecithin retinol acyltransferase (Lrat), and other enzymes that participate in retinoid metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "1. **Appropriate evidence citations**: The model includes evidence from peer-reviewed literature with proper citation of PMIDs.\n",
      "2. **Detailed molecular activities**: The model captures specific molecular activities like lipoprotein lipase activity, retinol binding, retinol dehydrogenase activity, and retinyl-palmitate hydrolase activity.\n",
      "3. **Appropriate causal connections**: The model shows appropriate causal relationships using relation predicates like \"provides input for\" (RO:0002413) and \"directly negatively regulates\" (RO:0002630).\n",
      "4. **Proper context annotations**: Activities are properly contextualized with cellular locations (e.g., occurs_in GO:0005576 - extracellular region, GO:0005829 - cytosol) and biological processes (part_of GO:0001523 - retinoid metabolic process).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Complex Representation\n",
      "In the model, there is a chylomicron complex (GO:0042627) that enables retinoid binding. According to the \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\" guidelines, when the specific subunit carrying the activity is not known, using the GO complex term is appropriate. However, the complex is represented with \"members: []\" - an empty list. It would be helpful to annotate the known components of this complex if available.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Molecular Carrier Activities\n",
      "The model includes several proteins involved in retinol binding and transport. According to the \"Molecular carrier activity\" guidelines, carrier proteins that transport small molecules should use:\n",
      "- \"has input\" relation for the transported molecule\n",
      "- \"has output\" relation so the small molecule can be input for the next reaction\n",
      "\n",
      "While some of these relationships are present, others could be more clearly defined. For instance, the model shows Rbp1 (MGI:MGI:97876) with all-trans-retinol binding activity, but the complete carrier pathway could be more explicitly modeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Input/Output Relationships\n",
      "Some molecular functions have inputs or outputs specified, but others do not. For complete pathway modeling, it would be beneficial to ensure all relevant inputs and outputs are captured. For example:\n",
      "- Activity 67086be200002723 has appropriate input (CHEBI:17336 - all-trans-retinol)\n",
      "- Activity 67086be200002729 has primary input as CHEBI:17898 (all-trans-retinal)\n",
      "- However, some intermediary activities could have more clearly defined inputs/outputs\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Evidence Base\n",
      "While the model uses evidence from multiple PMIDs, examining one of the key papers (PMID:23362116) reveals important mechanistic details about the role of cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP1/Rbp1) in regulating retinoid metabolism. These mechanistic details from the literature support the model but could be more completely captured in some of the relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Consistency Check\n",
      "The model represents retinoid metabolism from the initial processing of retinoids by lipoprotein lipase, through binding by carrier proteins, to conversion between different retinoid forms (retinol, retinal, retinoic acid) by appropriate enzymes. This is consistent with what is known about retinoid metabolism:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Retinoids are transported in circulation as retinyl esters in chylomicrons\n",
      "2. Retinyl esters can be hydrolyzed to retinol\n",
      "3. Retinol is bound by cellular retinol binding proteins\n",
      "4. Retinol can be oxidized to retinal by retinol dehydrogenases\n",
      "5. Retinal can be further oxidized to retinoic acid\n",
      "6. Retinol can also be esterified for storage\n",
      "\n",
      "These key steps are included in the model, supporting its biological accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "1. Consider adding more detail to the chylomicron complex representation if component information is available.\n",

      "3. Complete any missing input/output annotations for intermediate steps in the pathway.\n",
      "4. Consider adding more detailed annotations about the role of Rbp1 in regulating retinoid homeostasis, as supported by the literature evidence.\n",

      "Overall, the model \"Retinoid Metabolic Process 4 (Mouse)\" (gomodel:67086be200002705) is a well-constructed representation of retinoid metabolism that follows most GO-CAM best practices. With the suggested improvements, particularly in complex representation and carrier protein modeling, the model could provide an even more complete picture of retinoid metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model correctly captures the flow of retinoids from extracellular transport to cellular processing and metabolism, with appropriate causal connections between activities, making it a valuable resource for understanding retinoid metabolism in mouse.\n",

      "\n",
      "# GO-CAM Model Review: Cacna1a (MGI:MGI:109482)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([gomodel:MGI_MGI_109482](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:MGI_MGI_109482)) represents the mouse Cacna1a gene, which encodes a voltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1A. The model primarily documents the molecular activities of this calcium channel, its cellular locations, and some causal relationships with other proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Overview\n",
      "The model describes the Cacna1a protein's primary function as a voltage-gated calcium channel (GO:0005245) and high voltage-gated calcium channel (GO:0008331), occurring in various neuronal cell types. It also shows some causal relationships between Cacna1a and other proteins in signaling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Strengths\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive molecular function annotation**: The model appropriately captures the primary molecular function of Cacna1a as a voltage-gated calcium channel.\n",
      "2. **Detailed cellular location information**: The model includes annotations for cellular locations where Cacna1a functions, including specific neuron types like Purkinje cells (CL:0000121) and granule cells (CL:0000120).\n",
      "3. **Evidence-based assertions**: Each annotation is supported by literature evidence with appropriate ECO codes and PubMed references.\n",
      "4. **Some causal relationships**: The model includes some causal relationships showing how Cacna1a activity affects other proteins in signaling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Redundant annotations**: There are many redundant annotations for the same molecular function (GO:0003674 - molecular_function) with different evidence codes. These should be consolidated to improve model clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Limited causal relationships**: Given the importance of this calcium channel in various signaling pathways, the model would benefit from more detailed causal relationships showing how its activity connects to downstream processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pathway context**: While the model shows some relationships with Penk (MGI:MGI:104629), Sst (MGI:MGI:98326), and Cck (MGI:MGI:88297), the broader biological pathway context could be more clearly defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex representation**: As a voltage-gated calcium channel, Cacna1a typically functions as part of a multi-subunit complex. According to the UniProt entry, \"Voltage-dependent calcium channels are multisubunit complexes, consisting of alpha-1, alpha-2, beta and delta subunits in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\" The model would benefit from representing these interactions according to the guidelines for representing complexes in GO-CAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Molecular mechanism details**: The model could include more details about how the channel functions mechanistically (e.g., voltage sensing, conformational changes) based on the UniProt information about the S4 segments functioning as voltage sensors.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Biological process context**: While there are some part_of relationships to biological processes, the model would benefit from more explicit connections to the various biological processes listed in UniProt (e.g., calcium ion transport, neurotransmitter release, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Causal Relationship Review\n",
      "\n",
      "The model includes three causal relationship instances:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Cacna1a (GO:0008331) -[RO:0002305]→ Cck (GO:0048018)\n",
      "   - This represents a negative causal relationship where Cacna1a activity negatively affects Cck receptor ligand activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Cacna1a (GO:0008331) -[RO:0002305]→ Sst (GO:0048018)\n",
      "   - This represents a negative causal relationship where Cacna1a activity negatively affects Sst receptor ligand activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Cacna1a (GO:0008331) -[RO:0002305]→ Penk (GO:0048018)\n",
      "   - This represents a negative causal relationship where Cacna1a activity negatively affects Penk receptor ligand activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there's a causal relationship with Cstl1 (GO:0008234) -[RO:0002629]→ Penk (GO:0048018), showing how Cstl1 peptidase activity directly positively regulates Penk activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "These causal relationships use appropriate relation ontology terms but would benefit from more context and intermediate steps to better describe the complete signaling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consolidate redundant annotations**: Remove duplicate GO:0003674 annotations and keep only the most specific molecular function terms with the strongest evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enhance complex representation**: Add representations of the other subunits of the calcium channel complex and their interactions with Cacna1a.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expand causal relationships**: Add more detail to the existing causal relationships and include additional ones that reflect the diverse roles of this calcium channel in neuronal signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add biological process context**: Create more explicit connections to biological processes such as calcium ion transport, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Include cellular component information**: Add information about the localization of the channel to specific neuronal structures such as synapses and dendrites as mentioned in UniProt.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Review pathway completeness**: Ensure that the signaling pathways involving Penk, Sst, and Cck are completely represented with all intermediate steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The current GO-CAM model for Cacna1a provides a solid foundation but would benefit from additional details about its molecular interactions, complex formation, and role in broader biological processes. By addressing the recommendations above, the model would provide a more comprehensive and informative representation of Cacna1a's functions and would better follow GO-CAM best practices.\n",

      "## GO-CAM Model Review: Yeast Gluconeogenesis Pathway (gomodel:YeastPathways_GLUCONEO-PWY-1)\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Model Information\n",
      "- **Title**: \"gluconeogenesis I - imported from: Saccharomyces Genome Database\"\n",
      "- **Taxon**: NCBITaxon:559292 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C)\n",
      "- **Status**: Production\n",
      "- **Source**: Imported from Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Structure Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive Pathway Coverage**: The model represents the entire gluconeogenesis pathway with 16 activity nodes, covering all major enzymatic steps from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proper Cellular Compartmentalization**: Activities are correctly localized, with most occurring in the cytosol (GO:0005829) and some in mitochondria (GO:0005739) where appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complete Information for Reactions**: Each enzyme activity includes appropriate inputs (substrates) and outputs (products), with all molecular entities properly identified with ChEBI terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Process Annotation**: All activities are correctly annotated as part of the gluconeogenesis process (GO:0006094).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Gene Product Specificity**: Each activity is enabled by specific yeast gene products with SGD identifiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Issues and Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Limited Causal Connectivity**: \n",
      "   - **Issue**: Most enzymatic steps lack causal relationships (RO:0002413 \"provides input for\") connecting them in the proper sequence. Only a few activities have causal connections.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Add causal relationships between all sequential steps to properly represent the flow of the pathway from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Redundant Activity Representations**:\n",
      "   - **Issue**: Several enzymes are represented multiple times with identical functions (e.g., three instances of GAPOXNPHOSPHN-RXN for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with different gene products).\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Consider using protein complexes where appropriate or at least link the redundant activities to show they catalyze the same step.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inconsistent Evidence Documentation**:\n",
      "   - **Issue**: All evidence is cited as ECO:0000313 (imported information) without specific literature references beyond the SGD pathway.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Add primary literature citations where possible to strengthen the evidence basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Mitochondrial Malate Dehydrogenase Connectivity**:\n",
      "   - **Issue**: There are two representations of L-malate dehydrogenase (NAD+) activity (MAE1 - both in the mitochondrion), but their connectivity to the rest of the pathway isn't fully established.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Clarify the role of mitochondrial activities in the pathway by adding appropriate transporters and causal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Missing Regulatory Information**:\n",
      "   - **Issue**: The model lacks any regulatory information about the pathway.\n",
      "   - **Recommendation**: Consider adding key regulatory influences on gluconeogenesis, such as inhibition by insulin signaling or activation during fasting states.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Comparison with Mouse Gluconeogenesis Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The mouse model (gomodel:61e0e55600001225) has several features that could enhance the yeast model:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete Causal Connectivity**: The mouse model fully connects all activities with causal relationships, clearly showing the pathway flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Transport Mechanisms**: The mouse model includes transport mechanisms between compartments (e.g., malate transport across mitochondrial membrane).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Stronger Evidence Base**: The mouse model includes diverse evidence codes with specific PMID references for each activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yeast Gluconeogenesis GO-CAM model is scientifically accurate in terms of the enzymes, substrates, products, and cellular locations. It provides a good representation of the pathway components but falls short in representing the pathway structure and flow. The model would benefit significantly from adding causal connections between the enzymatic steps to properly represent the sequential nature of gluconeogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model appears to be an automated import from SGD rather than a manually curated model, which explains some of its limitations. For it to be maximally useful, manual curation to add causal relationships and consolidate redundant activities would greatly enhance its utility as a knowledge representation.\n",

      "Based on my review of the GO-CAM model \"gomodel:YeastPathways_P4-PWY-1\" for the superpathway of threonine and methionine biosynthesis, here is my evaluation:\n",
      "\n",
      "## GO-CAM Review: Superpathway of threonine and methionine biosynthesis\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Overview:\n",
      "This model ([gomodel:YeastPathways_P4-PWY-1](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:YeastPathways_P4-PWY-1)) represents the superpathway of threonine and methionine biosynthesis in yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*). It was imported from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) and contains 11 activities with 52 objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model includes key enzymes involved in threonine and methionine biosynthesis with appropriate genes enabling the activities.\n",
      "2. **Detailed molecular inputs/outputs**: Each enzyme activity has clearly defined inputs (substrates) and outputs (products), following biochemical principles.\n",
      "3. **Cellular localization**: All activities are correctly annotated as occurring in the cytosol (GO:0005829), which is appropriate for this pathway in yeast.\n",
      "4. **Consistent biological process annotation**: All activities are annotated as part of threonine metabolic process (GO:0006566).\n",
      "5. **Proper evidence codes**: All annotations use ECO:0000313 (imported information used in automatic assertion) with appropriate references.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues Identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal connectivity is incomplete**: While some activities have causal connections using RO:0002411 (\"functionally upstream of\"), many activities in the pathway lack these connections. For example:\n",
      "   - ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE-DEHYDROGENASE-RXN should be causally connected to HOMOSERDEHYDROG-RXN\n",
      "   - HOMOSERDEHYDROG-RXN should be causally connected to HOMOSERINE-O-ACETYLTRANSFERASE-RXN or HOMOSERKIN-RXN depending on the branch\n",
      "   - THRESYN-RXN lacks causal connections to upstream reactions\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Duplicate annotation**: There are two instances of ASPAMINOTRANS-RXN (aspartate aminotransferase) with identical functions but enabled by different gene products (SGD:S000004017/AAT2 and SGD:S000001589/AAT1). While both enzymes exist, their redundant representation without differentiation (e.g., in subcellular localization or regulation) may confuse users about their biological roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing pathway branch annotation**: While the model has \"superpathway of threonine and methionine biosynthesis\" in the title, the activities are all annotated to \"threonine metabolic process\" (GO:0006566) rather than also including methionine metabolic process (GO:0006555) for the methionine branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Predicate usage**: The model uses RO:0002411 (\"functionally upstream of\") for causal connections, but according to GO-CAM guidelines, pathway steps should preferably use RO:0002413 (\"provides input for\") to represent direct substrate-product relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pathway context**: While this is a \"superpathway,\" it would benefit from higher-level process annotations that connect this pathway to larger cellular metabolic networks or biological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete causal connections**: Add missing causal links between activities to represent the complete pathway flow. Use RO:0002413 (\"provides input for\") to connect sequential enzymatic reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Distinguish duplicate enzymes**: For the duplicate ASPAMINOTRANS-RXN activities, add additional annotations to differentiate their roles (e.g., different regulatory contexts or expression patterns).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add methionine process annotation**: Activities in the methionine biosynthesis branch should also be annotated with GO:0006555 (methionine metabolic process).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add pathway context**: Consider adding higher-level process annotations to relate this pathway to amino acid biosynthesis generally or to cellular responses like amino acid starvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider pathway branching**: Make the branching of the pathway (into threonine and methionine branches) more explicit through additional annotations or comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "This GO-CAM model provides a good representation of the threonine and methionine biosynthesis pathway but would benefit from more complete causal connections between activities and clearer process annotations to distinguish the different branches of the pathway. The model follows most GO-CAM guidelines but could be improved for increased biological clarity and utility.\n",

      "\n",
      "This GO-CAM model represents the 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation to succinyl-CoA pathway in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker's yeast).

      "\n",
      "## Technical Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Structure and Connections\n",
      "The model contains three main activities carried out by the following gene products:\n",
      "1. **KGD1 (SGD:S000001387)** - oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity (GO:0004591)\n",
      "2. **KGD2 (SGD:S000002555)** - dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase activity (GO:0004149)\n",

      "\n",
      "### Annotation Quality\n",
      "- **Evidence codes**: Appropriate evidence codes are used (ECO:0000313 for imported information, ECO:0000315 for mutant phenotype evidence, ECO:0000304 for author statements, and ECO:0007005 for high-throughput assays)\n",
      "- **Literature support**: Multiple PMID references are cited (3528755, 2115121, 9175438, 16823961)\n",
      "- **Cellular location**: All activities are correctly annotated to occur in the mitochondrion (GO:0005739)\n",

      "\n",
      "### Molecular Inputs and Outputs\n",
      "The model properly captures the substrate-product relationships with inputs and outputs for each activity:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **2OXOGLUTDECARB-RXN (KGD1)**:\n",
      "   - Inputs: hydron (CHEBI:15378), 2-oxoglutarate (CHEBI:16810), chemical entity (CHEBI:24431)\n",
      "   - Outputs: chemical entity (CHEBI:24431), carbon dioxide (CHEBI:16526)\n",
      "\n",

      "   - Outputs: hydron (CHEBI:15378), NADH (CHEBI:57945), chemical entity (CHEBI:24431)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biological Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "This model accurately represents the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC), a critical multienzyme complex in the TCA cycle. Based on the referenced literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The three-step enzymatic reaction is properly represented with the correct enzymes in the appropriate order.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Based on PMID:3528755, LPD1 is correctly identified as the lipoamide dehydrogenase component, which affects both 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities. The paper demonstrates that mutation in LPD1 abolishes the activities of both enzymes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Based on PMID:2115121, KGD2 is correctly identified as the dihydrolipoyl transsuccinylase component (E2) of the complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Based on PMID:9175438, KGD1 is correctly identified as the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase component.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The mitochondrial localization of all three components is well-supported by PMID:16823961, which includes these proteins in the mitochondrial proteome.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. All activities are correctly annotated as part of cellular respiration (GO:0045333).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the GO-CAM annotation guidelines, this model follows best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Causal connections**: The activities are properly connected using appropriate causal predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence and references**: Each assertion includes appropriate evidence codes and is linked to published literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cellular context**: The activities are properly localized to the mitochondrion.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Inputs and outputs**: Each activity has properly annotated inputs and outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complex annotation**: The model follows the guideline for complexes where each subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex has a defined activity. Rather than representing the complex as a whole, each component is represented with its specific molecular function, which is the preferred approach when individual activities are known (as specified in \"How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM\").\n",
      "\n",
      "## Areas for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "While the model is scientifically accurate and well-structured, a few minor improvements could be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Chemical entity annotation**: The generic \"chemical entity\" (CHEBI:24431) appears as both input and output in all activities, which is somewhat vague. This could potentially be replaced with more specific chemical entities if the exact cofactors or intermediate metabolites are known.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biological process annotation**: While cellular respiration is correct, it might be helpful to also annotate these activities to the more specific \"tricarboxylic acid cycle\" (GO:0006099) biological process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional complex information**: While the model correctly follows the guideline for annotating complexes with known activities for each subunit, it might be helpful to explicitly note that these three proteins form the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the GO-CAM model \"YeastPathways_PWY-5084\" is scientifically accurate, well-structured, and follows GO-CAM best practices. It correctly represents the 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation to succinyl-CoA pathway with appropriate relationships between activities, proper evidence codes, and accurate biochemical inputs and outputs. The three enzymes of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex are properly represented with their specific activities, following the guideline for annotating complexes where the activity of each subunit is known.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is supported by multiple literature references that confirm both the enzymatic functions and the mitochondrial localization of these proteins, making it a reliable representation of this important biochemical pathway in yeast.\n",

      "The model represents the folate polyglutamylation pathway in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which is important for one-carbon metabolism. This pathway involves the addition of multiple glutamate molecules to folate derivatives, making them more effective coenzymes and preventing their efflux from cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Model Structure Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive pathway representation**: The model captures the key enzymatic activities in the folate polyglutamylation pathway, including dihydrofolate synthase (Fol3p/FOL3), dihydrofolate reductase (Dfr1p/DFR1), and folylpolyglutamate synthase (Met7p/MET7).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Molecular details**: The model appropriately includes input and output molecules for each reaction, including ATP, folate derivatives, glutamate, and other relevant metabolites.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subcellular localization**: All activities are correctly annotated as occurring in the cytosol (GO:0005829), which is consistent with known folate metabolism in yeast.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological process annotation**: All activities are appropriately linked to the folate metabolic process (GO:0046655).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evidence capture**: Each annotation includes evidence codes (ECO:0000313) and references to the source pathway (SGD_PWY:PWY3O-20).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Limited causal relationships**: Only two activities (dihydrofolate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase) have causal relationships defined using RO:0002411 (causally upstream of). The model would better represent the pathway flow if causal relationships were added between all sequential steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Missing activity connections**: Several enzymatic steps are not causally linked, making it difficult to interpret the flow of the pathway. For example, there are no causal connections between many of the folylpolyglutamate synthase (Met7p) activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Redundant activity annotations**: The model contains multiple instances of the same enzyme activities (e.g., multiple nodes for folylpolyglutamate synthase activity by MET7/SGD:S000005767) that appear to represent different reaction instances but aren't clearly distinguished in their roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **No regulatory relationships**: The model lacks any regulatory relationships (using RO:0002629 or RO:0002630), which might be important for understanding pathway control.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Content Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gene product annotation**: The model correctly uses SGD identifiers for yeast proteins (e.g., SGD:S000005767 for Met7p).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Chemical entities**: The model uses appropriate ChEBI identifiers for all small molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evidence codes**: The model consistently uses ECO:0000313 (imported information used in automatic assertion) with appropriate provenance tracking.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Biological alignment**: The enzymatic activities in the model align with the known biochemistry of folate polyglutamylation in yeast, as confirmed by literature and SGD pathway resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Improvement\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add causal connections**: Connect all activities in the pathway with appropriate causal relationships (RO:0002411 - causally upstream of) to show the flow of the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarify redundant activities**: Either consolidate redundant activities or clearly differentiate their specific roles in the pathway (e.g., different substrates or products).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider adding regulatory relationships**: If known from literature, include any regulatory relationships that affect the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add more specific evidence**: Consider strengthening evidence by including specific experimental references beyond the general pathway citation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Improve model parsimony**: The current model has some redundancy in representation. A more streamlined model with clearer causal connections would improve human readability while maintaining biological accuracy.\n",

      "- Some activities appear to be duplicated (e.g., gomodel:2.7.7.1-RXN appears twice with different gene products), which may be confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Issues Identified\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Causal Connections**: Many expected causal connections between sequential enzymatic steps are not specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Duplicated Activity IDs**: The same activity ID (e.g., gomodel:2.7.7.1-RXN, gomodel:ARYLFORMAMIDASE-RXN, gomodel:NICONUCADENYLYLTRAN-RXN) is used for different gene products, which is potentially confusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Duplicate Output Molecules**: Some activities list the same molecule twice in their outputs (e.g., CHEBI:32544 appears twice as output of gomodel:NICOTINAMID-RXN).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Self-referential Causal Association**: There is a case where an activity is causally upstream of itself (gomodel:NAD-SYNTH-GLN-RXN), which appears erroneous.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Reaction Identifiers**: The model uses reaction identifiers (e.g., RXN-8441) as activity IDs rather than more descriptive IDs, which makes the model harder to interpret without additional context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Add Missing Causal Connections**: Complete the causal connections between sequential reactions to better represent the pathway flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Fix Duplicate Activity IDs**: Use unique IDs for each activity instance, even if they represent similar reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Remove Duplicate Molecules**: Ensure each molecule appears only once in input/output lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fix Self-referential Causality**: Remove or correct the self-referential causal association in gomodel:NAD-SYNTH-GLN-RXN.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Better Document Reaction Steps**: Consider adding comments to clarify the different branches of the NAD biosynthesis pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Check for Completeness**: Verify that all known enzymatic steps in the NAD biosynthesis pathway in yeast are represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model for the superpathway of NAD biosynthesis from SGD provides a comprehensive representation of the biochemical reactions involved in NAD biosynthesis in yeast. While the model captures the essential components (gene products, molecular functions, cellular locations, and chemical entities), it could be improved by better representing the causal flow of the pathway and addressing the issues with duplicate identifiers and molecule listings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the model is biologically accurate and follows most GO-CAM best practices, but the connectivity and organizational issues should be addressed to improve its clarity and usefulness.\n",

      "## GO-CAM Review: TCA Cycle (YeastPathways_TCA-EUK-PWY)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Model Overview\n",
      "This GO-CAM model ([https://bioregistry.io/go.model:YeastPathways_TCA-EUK-PWY](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:YeastPathways_TCA-EUK-PWY)) represents the TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle, also known as citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was imported from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) and models the aerobic respiration process (GO:0009060).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive representation**: The model captures all key enzymatic steps of the TCA cycle with appropriate gene products, molecular functions, inputs, and outputs.\n",
      "2. **Cellular localization**: Most activities are correctly annotated to occur in the mitochondrion (GO:0005739), which is the correct subcellular location for the TCA cycle.\n",
      "3. **Complex representation**: Protein complexes (e.g., succinate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase) are correctly represented according to GO-CAM guidelines, with their component subunits listed.\n",
      "4. **Complete chemical transformations**: Each reaction includes appropriate substrate and product molecules with their CHEBI identifiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Issues Identified\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inconsistent Causal Relationships**:\n",
      "   - Only a few causal relationships (RO:0002411 \"directly provides input for\") are established between reactions, specifically:\n",
      "     - Aconitate hydratase (ACO1) to aconitate dehydratase (ACO2)\n",
      "     - Succinate-CoA ligase to succinate dehydrogenase\n",
      "     - 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase to isocitrate dehydrogenase\n",
      "   - The majority of reactions lack causal connections, making it difficult to follow the complete cycle flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Duplicate Entries**:\n",
      "   - There are duplicate entries for some reactions:\n",
      "     - Three separate citrate synthase activities (enabled by CIT1, CIT2, CIT3)\n",
      "     - Two separate malate dehydrogenase activities (enabled by MDH1, MAE1)\n",
      "     - Two separate aconitate hydratase activities (enabled by ACO1, ACO2)\n",
      "     - Two separate pyruvate carboxylase activities (enabled by PYC1, PYC2)\n",
      "   - While these may represent isozymes, they are disconnected and not shown as alternative paths in the pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Conflicting Cellular Locations**:\n",
      "   - Some TCA cycle enzymes are annotated to the cytosol (GO:0005829) rather than mitochondrion:\n",
      "     - Aconitate hydratase (ACO1, ACO2) - in cytosol\n",
      "     - Pyruvate carboxylase (PYC1, PYC2) - in cytosol\n",
      "   - This is inconsistent with the canonical TCA cycle location (mitochondria).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Inconsistent Complex Representation**:\n",
      "   - Succinate dehydrogenase complex has two representations with different subunit compositions:\n",
      "     - One with SGD:S000218027 (proper complex ID) containing SDH1, SDH2, SDH3, SDH4\n",
      "     - Another with GO:0032991 (generic complex) containing SDH2, SDH3, SDH4, SDH9\n",
      "   - This inconsistency creates confusion about the actual complex composition.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Incomplete Activity Flow**:\n",
      "   - The model does not completely represent the cyclic nature of the TCA cycle.\n",
      "   - Many reactions that should be connected are isolated (e.g., citrate synthase to aconitase).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Complete the causal relationships**:\n",
      "   - Add \"directly provides input for\" (RO:0002411) relationships between all consecutive reactions to represent the cycle properly.\n",
      "   - Ensure the cycle is closed by connecting malate dehydrogenase to citrate synthase.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consolidate duplicate entries**:\n",
      "   - If different isozymes perform the same reaction in the same compartment, use causal relationships to indicate they are alternatives.\n",
      "   - Alternatively, document in comments why multiple instances of the same reaction are represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Correct subcellular localization**:\n",
      "   - Review and correct the cellular location annotations to ensure all TCA cycle enzymes are properly localized.\n",
      "   - If some reactions genuinely occur in the cytosol (e.g., in alternate pathways), this should be clearly documented.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Standardize complex representation**:\n",
      "   - Resolve the inconsistency in the succinate dehydrogenase complex representation by using a single consistent complex ID with the correct subunits.\n",
      "   - Follow the GO-CAM guidelines for complexes (option 1 or 2 from the document).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add biological context**:\n",
      "   - Include additional annotations or comments to explain the biological relevance of certain features (e.g., why some enzymes are in the cytosol).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "The GO-CAM model for the yeast TCA cycle provides a valuable representation of this critical metabolic pathway. While it captures most enzymatic steps correctly, it would benefit from improved causal connections between reactions, consistent subcellular localizations, and standardized complex representations. These improvements would make the model more accurate and easier to interpret, especially for researchers unfamiliar with the TCA cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is consistent with known biochemistry of the TCA cycle but requires refinement in how the enzymes and reactions are connected to fully represent the cycle's flow and compartmentalization.\n"
